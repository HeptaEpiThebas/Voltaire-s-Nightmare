 ANJ_ideas_bonus: "Angevin Ambitions"
 ANJ_idea_1: "Only True Heir"
 ANJ_idea_1_desc: "We, the dukes of Anjou, are directly related to the powerful Angevin dynasty. There are many who claim this honor, but we own this very hinterland, the theoretical heart of the empire. While the medieval age may pass, the age of dynastic empires never will."
 ANJ_idea_2: "Realm of diversity"
 ANJ_idea_2_desc: "Our home dynasty once united such varied cultures from across Europe that the wisest men could not speak even half of the languages spoken in Angevin kingdom and duchies. Each of the Angevins had to adapt. We need for our rulers to not be distant monarchs, far away from the common people's problems, but to be caring and protective for every culture that inhabits their realm."
 ANJ_idea_3: "Legacy of dynastic conflicts"
 ANJ_idea_3_desc: "It is not easy to persuade people into fighting for succession, since most of common folk do not care about from where their suzerain comes, until he decides to close up with them – but this can be made only after winning said war! When we are in need of regular armies, we have an advantage though: Italian condottieri, Hungarian riders, French raubritters, and even Gallowglasses from the British Isles are for our disposal... Not cheaply though. However, we have some experience in gaining lower prices, since dynastic conflicts of our dynasty tormented Europe for nearly 200 years."

Although some evidence, we mantain, proves that the assassin was a little chubby girl trained from childhood to be professional killer, we must admit that she created a great advantage for us and she deserved a cookie. We shall call the art of monarch elimination 'Advanced Dynastic Management' and teach it to our spies abroad, to help us in incoming dynastic struggles. Even if we don't murder anybody along the way, spying efficiency will rise."
 ANJ_idea_5: "Apocalypse Tapestry"
 ANJ_idea_5_desc: "Our proud heritage of cultural supremacy is best marked by enormous tapestry presenting the end of all times, once commissioned by duke Louis. When a story is so terrifying, enlarging it to hundreds of feet of artfully-woven cloth results in inevitable shock and obedience to the will of God Himself. And who is the man chosen by the Lord's will to rule these lands? Yes, that's right... you. No man will flinch on the battlefield when they know obedience to the duke is obedience to a powerful God, and whoever dies will be resurrected right after the Dies Irae he saw on the tapestry."
 ANJ_idea_6: "Chateaux of Loire Valley"
 ANJ_idea_6_desc: "Among abundant fields of artichoke and asparagus, vineyards, and berry bushes stand, like white mountains shading the Loire valley, simultaneously mighty and delicate chateauxs.

 ANJ_idea_7: "Tuffeau"
 ANJ_idea_7_desc: "Those chateauxs we may boast about are beautiful for a reason: they are built using tuffeau: light, radiant stone that continues to impress foreigners when they see villages of it, bathed in sunlight.

Although we're sure that our arms won't fail us, it will be imposible to stand alone in the face of ever increasing threats. We must use our ties among Hanseantic city-states and exploit the conflicts and divisions between surrounding enemies to create a more universal diplomatic policy and acquire our independence for a prolonged time."
 DMR_idea_2: "Wahr di, Garr, de Buer de Kumt"
 DMR_idea_2_desc: "Many knights, nobles, and kings have treated our militia with disrespect and disdain, only to gravely regret their mistake, facing humiliating defeat. Living and toiling in marshy terrain is what made us tough, organised, and self-reliant. However, with a new age of warfare, simply being organised won't do. We need to adapt a more stiff, regular approach, and transform our peasants' army into a true, centralized armed forces comprised of citizens willing to give their life for Dithmarscher liberty."
 DMR_idea_3: "Dikes of Dithmarschen"
 DMR_idea_3_desc: "Dikes are like veins to Dithmarschen, allowing a large part of the population to survive and also playing a crucial role in our defence system. Again, by adapting a centralized approach to dike building and carefully planning our defence lines we will be able to increase productivity of our lands as well as change our tiny homeland into an unpenetrable fortress."
 DMR_idea_4: "Devotion to Virgin Mary"
 DMR_idea_4_desc: "Under the banner of Virgin Mary we have repelled innumerable invasons of powerful foes and with her image we have been sealing our laws and acts. Regardless of the faith we will choose to follow, devotion is common among Dithmarscher peasants and will serve as an additional factor uniting our society."
 DMR_idea_5: "Landsgemeinde"
 DMR_idea_5_desc: "Although Dithmarschen enjoys unified customary laws, centralised law enforcement, and an administration conducted by a council of 48 judges, land assembly is still a dominant form of lawmaking in Dithmarschen. While times may call for adopting a less democratic and time-absorbing form of government, we know that someone needs to oversee state officials' actions (especially in a society connected by strong clan ties, like ours) so that justice can be made."
 DMR_idea_6: "Adopt Economical Liberalism"
 DMR_idea_6_desc: "What scholars and learned men have proclaimed as 'liberalism' was long before practiced in Dithmarschen. Being always opposed to government opression and tyranny and posessing still quite an attractive trading position, we should adopt laissez-faire doctrine and allow our citizens to prosper due to trade free of state interference."
 DMR_idea_7: "A Shining City on A Terp"
 DMR_idea_7_desc: "With advents of the new age, revolutionaries proclaiming liberty and equality, we will be an example to all those who would seek an implementation of their utopia into life. If we will mantain respect for ideals of self-government and democracy; the Republic of Dithmarschen will complete its transformation from autonomous peasant communes to a modern citizen-state well-suited for the future."

 HiberNor_ideas_start: "Hiberno-Norman Traditions"
 HiberNor_ideas_bonus: "Hiberno-Norman Ambitions"
 HiberNor_idea_1: "Invaders in Decline"
 HiberNor_idea_1_desc: "What is happening now might be the end of our dominance in Eire. Following Strongbow, we almost conquered and civilised this island – but lack of support from Britain was one of many reasons for our failure. If we are to at least keep our current position, we have to prepare for conflict, and the best way to do this is keeping trust in the prime source of Norman success: mounted knights."
 HiberNor_idea_2: "Gaelic Assimilation"
 HiberNor_idea_2_desc: "It rarely happens that new settlers don't accept parts of the neighboring culture as their own, and they often even adopt their way of life and language, especially if your neighbors have some hearty jigs. It may be possible we are not real strangers anymore, but the same folk as the Irish; and while some say we became 'more Irish then the Irish' we are proud of our mixed heritage."
 HiberNor_idea_3: "Tower Houses"
 HiberNor_idea_3_desc: "Invaders are never welcome, and so we were. Our first manors had to be tiny fortresses. Although in the incoming age of gunpowder they have no use in real warfare, they will effectively nip any attempts of local rebellions in the bud."
 HiberNor_idea_4: "Legacy of Conquests"
 HiberNor_idea_4_desc: "Irishmen who perceived us as Englishmen would be shocked if they knew how many cultures we have assimilated into: French, Anglo-Saxon, Sicilian, Greek, perhaps even Arabian in some time. Such was the energy of our ancestors, they've left their influence all over the world. We have plenty of states where we can search for common ground and understanding."
 HiberNor_idea_5: "Feudal Emissaries"
 HiberNor_idea_5_desc: "The English have allegedly brought the Irish a more 'civilised' form of goverment by establishing feudalism. Former counties were split into so-called cantreds. Although our assimilated culture has turned this feudalism into a more clan-like form, we have a great advantage in terms of connection with numerous subjects and eventual lieges."
 HiberNor_idea_6: "Statutes of Kilkenny"
 HiberNor_idea_6_desc: "Attemps of turning our culture back to 'proper' English haven't succeeded, as the Crown didn't have enough power to enforce them. Right now, however, the Crown has no power at all and we are vunerable to enemy invasions. The only useful thing we could bring out from these Statutes is advice to train more of our settlers in tradional English fighting sports like archery or lancing, so that more citizens of our realm will have the opportunity to effectively stand in defence of our homeland."
 HiberNor_idea_7: "Settlement Experience"
 HiberNor_idea_7_desc: "As with most states that relied heavily on settlers, we have much experience in arranging for more potential folks coming to the wild land just around the corner. After all, our hearts may be Irish, but our minds and bodies still serve the English purpose!"

 CRN_idea_1_desc: "Celts have been pushed out of the Hai Prettanai mainland long ago, and currently are barely holding the mountains of Caledonia, hills of Cymru, and the Kerno peninsula. If we, sons of Quonimorus, are to remain in control of our ancestors' sacred land, we have to quickly train young warriors."
 CRN_idea_2: "Tintagel"

 CRN_idea_4_desc: "We have been blessed by God with rich ores of tin and copper. They boost our industry and let us produce cheaper cannons."
 CRN_idea_5: "Cornish Stannary Parliament"
 CRN_idea_5_desc: "Tin miners, whose work powers our economy, are judged by their own parliament; except for matters of land, life, and death. That way they can assure justice without the Crown directly involving itself in their lives."
 CRN_idea_6: "The Legend of Tristan and Iseult"
 CRN_idea_6_desc: "Although Tristan's mission to bring Princess Iseult to King Mark ended with them both falling madly in love with each other, our future envoys are instructed to stay away form any magical potions along their way to avoid diplomatic affairs. If somebody thought legends and superstitions have no effect on our kingdom... Just look what happens to the peasant rabble when it sees a comet."
 CRN_idea_7: "Find the Avalon"

 CrusaderS_idea_2: "Another Crusaders' Kings"
 CrusaderS_idea_2_desc: "Great names like Godefroid de Bouillon or Guy de Lusignan are, unfortunately, relics of the past: times are changing, and we don't need either feudal scrambles or brave knights in shining armor, which are so easy to shoot through! We will end with the old order, but never overlook a need for a large number of sons: all their bad traits and flaws seemingly lose any meaning, and there will be no problem with having many children: local maids are swarthy and voluptuous..."
 CrusaderS_idea_3: "Outremer trade"
 CrusaderS_idea_3_desc: "Silk! Spices! Fruits, pistachios, nuts, almonds, dates! Vanillas, mmh, yes, sweet vanillas! WINE!  MORE WINE! By God Almighty, everything so fresh, so tasty, so shiny and beautiful! Trade with Venice and Genoa is profitable enough that if I were to give one florin to a beggar for each ten thousand florins some merchant gains, he would be rich by midnight! Let us profit from this, for there is no other way to India that through the East! Those foolish Portuguese, how they can think they can sail south and find passage there? Nay, nay, there are monsters there! Dumb Iberians..."
 CrusaderS_idea_4: "Dry Wells"
 CrusaderS_idea_4_desc: "When you reach the countryside, everything is dry, as sand or my head this morning. Often even wells in abandoned villages are dry, and pity on he who encounters such a well during his march. It is critical for us to secure water supplies and be ready for future campaigns against the heretics."
 CrusaderS_idea_5: "Crusader Marines"
 CrusaderS_idea_5_desc: "Italian mercenary fleets we hired to reach Constantinople were often ill suited for fighting. We should create our own armadas, and embark them with some of the greatest warriors mankind has ever seen. Those will be Crusader Marines, and they shall know no fear!"
 CrusaderS_idea_6: "Ordos Militans"
 CrusaderS_idea_6_desc: "He who has piety in his heart, sword in his hand, blue blood in his veins, dust in his chests, and a tiny swathe of land should join a militant order and sacrifice his life for the greater good, fighting heathen and heretic. He would best do this job, however, by simply becoming an officer, inspiring and introducing his men to strict monastic discipline. If we manage to get a whole cadre of these officers, our armies would become unstoppable."
 CrusaderS_idea_7: "Brothers in faith"
 CrusaderS_idea_7_desc: "Everyone wants to be saved, but not everyone can or will crusade overseas. So, through giving us gifts, military backup, or filthy lucre they get what they want. The notion that we are the guardians of our Lord's footsteps creates a worldwide reputation of us as honest (hah!), proud men, which is beneficial for our diplomatic look, not only among grateful brothers in faith. Put the chicken wings down and come crusade, bro."

 TOU_idea_1_desc: "Toulouse was once a capital of the vast kingdom of the Visigoths, who embraced the Arian faith and made ground in what is now called France. We are proud dukes of the place where modern history formed, and we should strive to have as many men as possible to recreate ancient empires."
 TOU_idea_2: "Spanish March"
 TOU_idea_2_desc: "Similarly to Champagne, we also were an independent country, located on what was once the so-called Marca Hispanica of the Frankish Empire. Beyond the Pyrenees, Arabic invaders could always find prepared fortresses, assembled troops, and battle-hardened people. To a second Tours!"
 TOU_idea_3: "Center of Occitania"
 TOU_idea_3_desc: "Our county is undisputably the birthplace of high and sophisticated Occitain culture. We would clearly be the foremost in arts and science – if not for corrupted crusaders and the vile kings of France. It hasn't been long since those times -  now that we are free, whe should regain our affluence!"
 TOU_idea_4: "Consistori del Gay Saber"
 TOU_idea_4_desc: "Consistory of the Gay Science isn't about finding new ways for spoiled young nobles to sodomise themselves – its something created to preserve fine chants and songs of troubadours for future Occitain generations. We should promote poetry for contenting young nobles in more moral way, preserving lenga d'Oc and keeping our country stable."
 TOU_idea_5: "Capitouls"
 TOU_idea_5_desc: "The city of Toulouse began to free itsel from feudal laws early, and in 1152 'Capitouls' was founded, an assembly of city administrators that rivaled the count and fought for burghers' rights. Giving our cities privileges might be useful, when it bears us larger control over trade..."
 TOU_idea_6: "The Perfecti"
 TOU_idea_6_desc: "Seeing the incoming wave of Enlightment sprawling across Europe, we might expect that from villages hidden deep in Languedoc hills Cathar preachers will come: the Perfecti, living ascetic lifestyles and teaching people about who really created the world and who is really worshipped by Catholic priests. We should take advantage and either use them as priests of New Christianity or learn their methods and hunt down the Good Men once for all."
 TOU_idea_7: "Remember the Montsegur"
 TOU_idea_7_desc: "None can say Good Men were sinners, without being a sinner himself. None can say Cathars were vile and malicious, without being vile and malicious himself. None can say crusaders saved the souls of people they burned at stakes, without having his soul bound eternally to the Satanic construct of Earth. Yet they said those lies, and repeat them while walking upon ashes of murdered people, and we may justly tell our troops, marching on to fight enemies of Toulouse, paraphrasing words of Arnaud Amaury, butcher of Beziers: kill them all, Satan will sort out his own."
#Liege

 LIE_ideas_bonus: "Liegian Ambitions"
 LIE_idea_1: "Guarding the Imperial Border"
 LIE_idea_1_desc: "Long has the Empire relied on us in matters of holding the Imperial border. However, times are trying and neighboring France increases its influence on our prince-bishopric. We need to prepare for inevitable struggles that are going to shake our state."
 LIE_idea_2: "Eternal Neutrality"
 LIE_idea_2_desc: "Seemingly endless struggles for seat of Prince-Bishop have resulted after nearly 30 years of conflict in proclamation of neutrality, which was confirmed by both relevant sides: the Empire and the Kingdom of France. We will try to avoid needless struggles and conduct our diplomacy in such a way that we can thrive in peace and not amidst constant war."
 LIE_idea_3: "Bonnes Villes"
 LIE_idea_3_desc: "Those cities that were of greatest importance in the realm were called 'Good Cities'. They had the right to build city walls and partake in administering the country by their representatives. Such a system respects rights and customs of various parts of the realm, no matter whether the language they speak is understood by the Prince-Bishop."
 LIE_idea_4: "Perron"
 LIE_idea_4_desc: "In addition to previously mentioned privileges, each Bonne Ville could erect a stone column on their town square with a globus cruciger atop of it, caller the Perron. Such a monument symbolises autonomy and freedom, both of the Prince-Bishopric and of the Good Cities. Represented on our coat of arms, standards and bagdes, it reminds each of our citizens that the state they live in is an oasis surrounded by nests of tyranny and malevolence, and their undeniable rights are guaranteed by the supreme authority of the Prince-Bishop, coming from God himself."
 LIE_idea_5: "Liegian Renaissance"
 LIE_idea_5_desc: "Under the benevolent rule of prince-bishop Erard de la Marck, finances of the state were restored and the city returned to its former glory. Also, many deposits of blue limestone and marble supported architectural development in Liège, resulting in the easily recognisable style of the Mosan renaissance. Spreading style will not only result in colourful and attractive cities, but also cheaper and more solid buildings."
 LIE_idea_6: "Promote Weapon Industry"
 LIE_idea_6_desc: "The age-old mining industry of coal and iron was always vital for our state's economic well-being, but with a time of revolution in science, industry, and philosophy, development of steel factories and the weapons industry is vital. Liège may never be short of citizens willing to fight for its freedom, but it is in our competence to provide these men guns and cannons."
 LIE_idea_7: "Liegian Revolution"
 LIE_idea_7_desc: "The sudden switch from an enlightened to an authoritarian Prince-Bishop has led to unrest so large that when the French Revolution began, almost immediately a Liegian Revolution broke out. We should resurrect the legacy of the 'Athens of three Gauls', as Liège was called in the Dark Ages, wherein liberal city government and progressive reforms created a short-lived but powerful rebellion against high-class oppression, bigotry, and intolerance."

 CHP_idea_1: "Royal Seneschals"
 CHP_idea_1_desc: "All courtiers in the French royal court had to obey a seneschal: he also administrated royal domains and replaced the King in many matters when he was absent. Such great power in the Kingdom of France was hereditary to counts of Champagne: now one of the contestants for the throne in Paris. Our past gives us great knowledge in civil matters and administration."
 CHP_idea_2: "Champagnian independence"
 CHP_idea_2_desc: "It is imperative for us to know that we were nearly an independent county; we definitely have the most experience in how to be sovereign rulers, and it shows."
 CHP_idea_3: "Champagne Fairs"
 CHP_idea_3_desc: "In latter days Champagnian fairs were a main contributor to abundance and prosperity in Champagne. Incorporation of Champagne into France made them lose their importance. We are independent, for now, and should strive to make cities like Provins and Brie full of Italian merchants again."
 CHP_idea_4: "Battle of Chalons"
 CHP_idea_4_desc: "It is on our ground where Hunnic hordes were stopped and crushed by Aetius, the Last Roman. We are proud to host such sacred ground, and we are bound to learn from Romans abount their tactics and strategy, which saved Europe from utter destruction."
 CHP_idea_5: "Cathedral of Reims"
 CHP_idea_5_desc: "In the cathedral in our capital the Kings of France had to be crowned, and that gives us a great advantage in uniting the shattered country – we already have the required place of coronation. While our architects and engineers work on strenghtening its defence, we should learn how to strenghten the ties between duchies that will bow to us when we unite France."
 CHP_idea_6: "Thibaut the Troubadour's Chants"
 CHP_idea_6_desc: "One of counts of Champagne and King of Navarre as well, Thibaut de Blois, was a famous crusader and poet. The Renaissance wave that arrived in our lands from Italy might cause a revolution in our arts and poetry, but his call to holy war will never be drowned out: \nQui n'a en soi pitié ni souvenance,  \nAu haut Seigneur doit chercher sa vengeance,  \nEt délivrer sa terre et son pays."
 CHP_idea_7: "Champagne"
 CHP_idea_7_desc: "Our wines were always highly prized, but one monk known as Dom Perignon was said to have invented a wine that became famous not only as the drink of royalty and great people, but also as 'the wine of civilization'; a beverage that is somewhat like a landmark of the West and its whole cultural heritage. Considering its taste... words can't describe it. Poetry merely offers a weak facsimile. One can only drink it to know what Champagne is, and through its bubbles new ideas flow into the minds of great politicians and kings. Cork pops will sign great Champagnian military victories and successes of science and diplomacy."

 KOL_idea_2: "Archchancellor of Italy"
 KOL_idea_2_desc: "We don't know why the title 'Archchancellor of Italy' has been passed to somebody who resides hundreds of miles beyond the Alps, but no matter how far we are from our 'domains' we keep in hand the powerful tool of Italian-style diplomacy. The prestige of carrying the highest honours in the Reich attracts cunning diplomats to our palace in Bonn."
 KOL_idea_3: "Kurfurst und Burgmeister"
 KOL_idea_3_desc: "Why in Bonn, and not in Cologne? Well, the truth is that constant conficts between the Archbishop and burghers resulted in the secession of our nominal capital as the Free City Cologne. We should rethink our opinions on trade and divine supremacy, and turn the other cheek: if we will establish an agreement, we can get access to lucrative Rhine commerce in the richest of inland Hanseantic cities!"
 KOL_idea_4: "Kölner Dom"
 KOL_idea_4_desc: "To be in Cologne and not to see the maginificent cathedral, is to be blind... as from every street, square, and building it can be seen dominating the city skyline. Housing innumerable treasures and relics,  including precious remnants of the Three Wise Men, it guarantees we will always stay true to only the Catholic faith."
 KOL_idea_5: "Rote Funken"
 KOL_idea_5_desc: "Regular troops of City of Cologne were called The Red Sparks for their astonishing red uniforms. Having an regular army in war-torn Empire is nearly a must, so we must cooperate with City to enchance our military performance."
 KOL_idea_6: "Wittelsbach archbishops"
 KOL_idea_6_desc: "The Wittelsbachs who couldn't count on inheriting any land from their fathers were destined to become Archbishops of Cologne. Ties with one of the grandest European dynasties make our state an important player on the continent."
 KOL_idea_7: "Eau de Cologne"
 KOL_idea_7_desc: "You can have a feast for the eyes in Cologne, watching the monumental cathedral; feast for the ears, hearing merry tunes of carnival; feast for the taste drinking Kolsch beer; feast for the touch admiring cloth in markets; and finally a feast for the smell through the aroma of Eau de Cologne, a one-of-a-kind perfume manufactured only here. Smell like an Archbishop, Archbishop. And don't drink it, despite the fact that it smells nice and is 80% alcohol. Kolsch is better and cheaper anyways."

We have learned what it means to be prepared for diseases, lack of food and water, and we will be always prepared to survive even years of siege. God helps those who help themselves..."
 AVI_idea_2: "Avignon Exhange"
 AVI_idea_2_desc: "We are prodigies in the modern-day economy: the new invention of foreign exchange markets was first established here in 1248. The Holy See used it to mantain numerable financial relations with European monarchs, but now we are free. If we retrict its use to our economic adversaries, we will quickly see their economy falter."
 AVI_idea_3: "Republic of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_3_desc: "Because of our economic importance, we once declared ourselves a republic. Short was her life: feudal lords quickly subdued us to their rule. But we never forget that small communes should have a degree of autonomy, for it makes them more willing to assimilate."
 AVI_idea_4: "University of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_4_desc: "Rejoice! A wild horde of drunkards, rascals, and easygoers can come to our city and study there! Nothing good will come of this, as every coin they pay us goes toward rebuilding what they have destroyed in their drunken rage. However, ages of dealing with students gave us experience at dealing with most unpleasant diplomats politely."
 AVI_idea_5: "Palais des Papes"
 AVI_idea_5_desc: "Lets face it: Avignon popes were not really rightful popes. Not truly independent, they marked the beggining of a schism tromenting the one true Catholic church. The Palace of Popes (and Antipopes) is a reminder of how they used to claim things that were not quite theirs. Who said it is not useful in politics?"
 AVI_idea_6: "Bridge of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_6_desc: "Legend has it the bridge in Avignon was built by Saint Benezet. When Jesus himself told him to create a passage across the Rhone, he formed The Bridge Brotherhood to help him in construction. Recreation of this Brotherood will enhance communication a lot."
 AVI_idea_7: "Great Schism"
 AVI_idea_7_desc: "We must remember the times when we were the seat of the spritual ruler of half of Europe: the Pope of Avignon was supported by kings of France, Scotland, Aragon and Castile. The time of Glory will come once more, hovever, not by the power of the Church, but by the power of our armies and subjects."

Burghers and peasants, whose ancestors with simple flails and goedendags ended the age of chivalrous cavalry charges, will join the ranks of our zealous infantry, which will keep even the strongest enemies at bay."
 FLA_idea_2: "Birthplace of Capitalism"
 FLA_idea_2_desc: "Ancient cites of Brugge, Ghent and Antwerp, the richest in Europe, and perhaps in the whole world, give our country countless riches, primarily from cloth manufacturing. With no counts or kings to supervise manufacturers or merchants, a new form of economic system is born: capitalism. No feudal lord will tell us how we make money."
 FLA_idea_3: "Flemish renaissance"
 FLA_idea_3_desc: "Great art works of masters like van Eyck, Petrus Christus, or van der Weyden enrich us with their beauty, change our way of thoughts, and manifest the cultural independence of our cities and patricians."
 FLA_idea_4: "Legacy of Antwerp"
 FLA_idea_4_desc: "The River Scheldt has seen innumerable ships docking at her estuary, where the city of Antwerp lies. It isn't a secret that citizens of this main trade hub are Flemish, but the experience in shipkeeping and pirate defense they have should be our secret only..."
 FLA_idea_5: "End the Beeldenstorm"
 FLA_idea_5_desc: "When the reformation arrived, groups of Calvinist fanatics began to purge churches of religious sculptures and paintings. Due to our familiarity with such revolts, we'll be able to return law and order much faster."
 FLA_idea_6: "Land of Humanism"
 FLA_idea_6_desc: "Rich merchants – despite what some may think – have more tolerance to improvements and philosophical progress than anybody else. Of course, only if these help them gain more wealth – but the more money we come across, the more refuge-seeking thinkers we see..."
 FLA_idea_7: "Stroppendragers"
 FLA_idea_7_desc: "When the citizens of Ghent rebelled against unjust taxes and the tyranny of emperor Charles VI n 1540, he stripped them of privileges, guild laws, city walls, and even clothes; and made them beg for mercy barefoot, with noose on their necks as the symbols of their guilt. Flamands, hovever, never lose their spirits. Even after such misfortunes we stand bravely in defence of our freedom, and Ghentiles, as well as every Flemish person, can proudly call himself a Stroppendrager – a man that despots would like to sentence to death."

We shall thus form an alliance within ourselves, to ensure that we will not be forced to accept any dominion. Let Virgin Mary bless our men of state and Archbishops so that they will be always understood in good trust, even if their sinful minds have no good intentions."
 Electoral_idea_2: "Rhein trade"
 Electoral_idea_2_desc: "The Rhein is a vein for imperial trade, and our location combined with prerogatives of Electorial dignities give us trade possibilities second only to the Dutch. But trading might be not the best way to gain money as Prince-Archbishops. Nevermind, we can get indulgences. Pecunia non olet."
 Electoral_idea_3: "Privilege of Non-Appeal "
 Electoral_idea_3_desc: "We also decree that absolutely no subject of the Cologne, Mainz, and Trier dioceses can be summoned at the instance of any plaintiff beyond these same territories to any foreign tribunal. Check your privilege, Electors! Subjects of ours Serene Highnesses cannot appeal to any higher court, thus making us truly lords on our lands. It is right and just for us to deliver Salomonic jugdments, as we are the deputy of Christ on Earth... but the Emperor might revoke this privilege. Nah, there are several reforms before that, they won't make it."
 Electoral_idea_4: "Archchancellors of the Empire"
 Electoral_idea_4_desc: "Chancellors are vital for any state: they conduct diplomacy and deal with state affairs that require the skill of thinking about more than how to conceive an heir or hunt a deer. Thus, we are necessary for the Reich. If we are responsible for its administration and expansion (at least nominally) why not use our skills for personal domains too?"
 Electoral_idea_5: "Cursed Article 13"
 Electoral_idea_5_desc: "For such privileges and charters, if, and in as far as, they are considered to derogate in any way from the liberties, jurisdictions, rights, honors or dominions of the said Prince Electors, or any one of them, in so far we revoke them of certain knowledge and cancel them, and decree, from the plenitude of our Imperial power, that they shall be considered and held to be revoked. \nWe could be true masters in our own castles – if not for article 13 of the Golden Bull, a perilous paragraph that gives the current Emperor the ability to revoke our rights whenever he wishes. Let him come, we say. We shall be prepared."
 Electoral_idea_6: "Indulgence trade"
 Electoral_idea_6_desc: "Sobald der Gülden im Becken klingt, im huy die Seel im Himmel springt! \nHear ye, hear ye! Save your soul and find yourself a cozy place in Heaven by buying an indulgence! Have kids? Buy some for them! Someone died in your family? Buy one for him or her too! And don't listen to any crazy monk that tries to convince you this is the fruit of Papal avarice and greed, don't mind that it is not fully consistent with Catholic doctrine – just take one and your conscience will be peaced down after the slaughter of battle, pillage, and rape!"
 Electoral_idea_7: "Three Lord Inquisitors"
 Electoral_idea_7_desc: "It seems that more than a few people were unsatisfied with the indulgence policies we brought. Now we're in the middle of a religious war with our own people. Heretical perversion and deceit have no bounds. Thus we should establish inquisitorial bases in our capitals, and give those Papal Grand Inquisitors permissions as large as there have to be for them to fight, burn, and root out heresy from the lands of Prince-Archbishops. We will be paragons of Catholic piety in the Holy Roman Empire."

 SXM_idea_4: "The Kyrburg Line"
 SXM_idea_4_desc: "The line of Kyrburg, which originated from the Wildgrave lands, was at the beginning in feud with other lines like the Dhaun line, and quickly inherited much land. Eventually they bore the title of Wild- and Rheingraf, and later they also acquired Obersalm and began titling themselves Count of Salm. Much of the Raugraviate was transferred to the electorate of the Palatinate."

 SXM_idea_7: "Expansions of the Nahegau"
 SXM_idea_7_desc: "Before it split into the Wild- and Raugraviates and into the county of Veldenz, the area was held by the early Medieval gau of Nahegau. The Nahegau, despite its smaller size, was successful at expanding."

 WGR_idea_2: "They Seperated From Us!"
 WGR_idea_2_desc: "After the end of the Nahegau, we became its successor state. But because we were weakened, the county of Veldenz and the Raugraviate were able to get free, making us even weaker. We should reclaim these lands!"
 WGR_idea_3: "No Generic Title"
 WGR_idea_3_desc: "Unlike other comital titles, Rheingraves, Wildgraves and Raugraves were not generic titles.

 SMX_ideas_bonus: "Sammarinese Ambitions"
 SMX_idea_1: "Saint Marinus"
 SMX_idea_1_desc: "Hailing from the Illyrian island of Rab, Saint Marinus came to Italy around the turn of the fourth century to escape Emperor Diocletian's persecution. He eventually founded a monastery on the future site of San Marino in 301 AD, and upon his death he allegedly stated 'Relinquo vos liberos ab utroque homine' - freeing the city from both Pope and Emperor - but it wasn't until the kindly noble Felicissima that the citizens were truly independent."
 SMX_idea_2: "The Oldest Republic"
 SMX_idea_2_desc: "Since the ancient Greeks, republics have dotted Europe. Even great Rome was once a republic, freed from the tyranny of Tarquinius Superbus, until the treachery of Julius Caesar led it once again towards autocracy. But while these republics fell, San Marino has stood testament to Republican ideals for centuries on end. May it last to the end of time!"
 SMX_idea_3: "Establish Captains Regent"
 SMX_idea_3_desc: "In 1243 the Sammarinese republic moved from its old system, the 'Arengo' - a council of family leaders similar to the Roman senate - to a dual position of Capitani Reggenti, more like Roman consuls. Their terms only lasted for six months, and each was nominated from an opposing party, ensuring a balanced government free from the ambitions of those who wished to establish hereditary rule."
 SMX_idea_4: "Mountain Commune"
 SMX_idea_4_desc: "The nucleus of San Marino is centered upon Monte Titano, making it easily defensible. It was only until the deposition of Sigismondo Pandolfo in the 1400s that the republic expanded to include other cities, though a tradition of civil disobedience remained in the population. When Cardinal Giulio Alberoni occupied the republic and forced a new constitution upon it, the citizens refused to bow to his demands and soon won back their freedom."
 SMX_idea_5: "Statutes of 1600"
 SMX_idea_5_desc: "The Statutes of 1600 were the first documents pertaining to the administration of the Republic. Soon after, the Republic signed a treaty with the Papal States guaranteeing its protection and independence. Though strained by later developments, this treaty lasted to nearly the end of the Papal States' existence as a politican entity."
 SMX_idea_6: "Napoleonic Friendship"
 SMX_idea_6_desc: "Napoleon's conquest of Italy put San Marino in a precarious situation, needing to balance its allegiance to the Papal States with the threat of French aggression. Surprisingly, San Marino inspired a personal fondness in Napoleon himself, who recognized the state's freedom, exempted it from taxation, wrote in praise to his commissars, and even offered to annex more territory to it. Though the Sammarinese declined this offer, they maintained a shared dedication to Republicanism."
 SMX_idea_7: "The Last Microstate"
 SMX_idea_7_desc: "During Giuseppe Garibaldi's wars to unify Italy into a single Kingdom, San Marino gave refuge to many persecuted Unificationists, including Garibaldi himself. In return, Garibaldi exempted San Marino from the new Italian state when he eventually won out over the other peninsular powers. Thus San Marino was left as the only Italian microstate left in existence, surrounded completely by the Kingdom. The Principality of Monaco remained independent as well, but had been as much in the orbit of France as Italy historically."
#Merania
 MER_ideas: "Meranian Ideas"

 MER_ideas_bonus: "Meranian Ambitions"
 MER_idea_1: "Duchy of the Sea"
 MER_idea_1_desc: "The Slovenian name for Merania was 'Vojvodina Meranija', coming from the native word for 'sea' - 'morje'. Though its lands were later centered around inland Bavaria and Franconia, it started out on the Adriatic roughly corresponding to the territory of the former Istrian March and Carniola. Some chroniclers even assigned it the whole Dalmatian littoral, though this claim is dubious as the Kingdom of Croatia firmly held these lands until Venetian incursions."
 MER_idea_2: "Reichsunmittelbarkeit"
 MER_idea_2_desc: "Imperial Immediacy held a ruler of the Holy Roman Empire to be a complete sovereign in his own lands, answerable only to the Emperor himself. The status was closely linked to the title Imperial Prince, and while both eventually became quite common throughout the empire, Merania was one of the earlier polities to enjoy these prestigious accolades. The Dukes were thus considered part of the highest noble ranks."
 MER_idea_3: "Serbian Connections"
 MER_idea_3_desc: "Friedrich Barbarossa's abortive Crusade was launched by land through the Balkans, starting by traveling through Merania. He negotiated a marriage between the Meranian duke's daughter and Prince Toljen of Hum, a relative of the rulers of Serbia. It is unknown whether the planned marriage took place, but regardless, Merania maintained a geographical and political connection with the Serbs."
 MER_idea_4: "Expand into Croatia"
 MER_idea_4_desc: "Much of Merania's titular territory was purely theoretical, lying under the de facto control of Croatia and Hungary. The Dukes did not hesitate, however, to expand at the expense of these Slavic states, conquering such cities as Gottschee and Tschernembl, and thus establishing a border that would last for nearly a thousand years and counting. Though eventually ending up under Slovene sovereignty, these freshly conquered cities became integral outposts in the Germanic empire's frontier."
 MER_idea_5: "Meranian Fever"
 MER_idea_5_desc: "The control of ports on a busy inland sea exposes one to numerous plagues and diseases. Learning from Italian neighbors, the Meranian subjects demonstrate an adeptness at naval management and warfare. From quarantines to cannonfire, a master can be found in any Meranian port."
 MER_idea_6: "The House of Andechs"
 MER_idea_6_desc: "The decadent house of Andechs, originating in Southwestern Bavaria, was invested with the Duchy of Merania towards the end of the twelfth century to balance power versus the Wittelsbachs. Though separated by vast gaps, the Andechser dukes held the original Adriatic lands, their homelands, massive Franconian holdings, the rich Tirolian city of Innsbruck, and even the Palatinate of Burgundy on the opposite side of the Empire."
 MER_idea_7: "Episcopal Loyalty"
 MER_idea_7_desc: "When Pope and Emperor took arms against each other for the second time since the Investiture Controversy, under the rule of the Hohenstaufens, the Dukes of Merania decided to stay loyal to their nominal overlord, the Bishop of Bamberg. Though this earned Duke Otto an Imperial Ban and the confiscation of all territories, none could say Merania was unloyal to the true faith."

 SCY_idea_6_desc: "The English region of Cumbria, falling on the lands of Strathclyde beyond the Solway Firth, was dominated by Carlisle Castle from the late 11th century onwards. Raising this magnificent castle would continue the spirit of Hadrian's Wall and boost our border defense."
 SCY_idea_7: "Appanage Legacy"

 ILE_idea_2: "Godred's Grave"
 ILE_idea_2_desc: "The great King of Sudreyjar, Godred Crovan, died of a pestilence on Islay. A standing stone near Carragh Bhan supposedly marks his eternal resting place, decorated with traditional Viking and Celtic art. Whether it really is Godred's tomb, the beautiful Ringerike patterns will forever decorate the island."
 ILE_idea_3: "Battle of Epiphany"
 ILE_idea_3_desc: "January 1156 saw a great battle between the Norse and the Norse-Gaels off the coast of Islay. Though it began on the night of Epiphany, it continued on throughout the next day until a stalemate. The people of Islay will always remember this engagement, and learn from the triumphs and failures of the many other fleets that have passed through our waters."
 ILE_idea_4: "Seat of the MacDomhnaills"
 ILE_idea_4_desc: "Domhnaill, grandson of Somerled, originally held Islay as a hereditary lordship within the family's greater Hebridean holdings. It was from this powerbase that the MacDomhnaill clan expanded their influence, eventually dominating the entire seaboard as one of the most powerful vassals of the Scottish crown."
 ILE_idea_5: "MacDubgall Forfeiture"

 ILE_idea_6: "Council of the Isles"
 ILE_idea_6_desc: "The advisors of the Lord of the Isles met at Eilean na Comhairle on Islay, occupying an ancient structure. One important document produced by the lord and advisors was the 1408 Islay Charter."
 ILE_idea_7: "Islay Whiskey"
 ILE_idea_7_desc: "The monarchs ruling Islay realized its potential for agriculture and moved to expand grain, oat, and barley farming across the island. One of the fruits of this endeavor was the creation of Islay Malt Whiskey, one of five main regional Whiskeys across the entirety of Scotland. The use of Peat in the brewing process gives the whiskey a smoky quality, attracting connoisseurs from across the world."

 AYL_idea_2: "Unite the Lordships"
 AYL_idea_2_desc: "The core lands of Argyll were originally divided between the lordships of Argyll Proper and of Lorne. In 1222, however, in recognition for royal assistance, Somerled's grandson Donnchad was invested with both titles, essentially uniting them."
 AYL_idea_3: "Dál Riata Heritage"
 AYL_idea_3_desc: "Argyll emerged as a political entity after the old Irish thalassocratic kingdom of Dál Riata was thrown into chaos, its mainland possessions being cleft from its islands. The Alban kingdom and numerous prominent dynasties claim descent from this ancient state, but our claim is one of the most legitimate."
 AYL_idea_4: "Diocese of Argyll"
 AYL_idea_4_desc: "Since the middle ages, Argyll was home to its own titular bishopric, seated at Saint Moluag's Cathedral in Lismore. Moluag is the patron saint of Argyll, adding on to the region's religious prestige."
 AYL_idea_5: "Kintyre"
 AYL_idea_5_desc: "Though it changed hands many times, the Kintyre peninsula is a jewel in the diadem of Argyll. From its famous Mull to its colorful history - such as the time a Norse king dragged his ships across it - Kintyre contributes to all facets of Argyllian strength and notability."
 AYL_idea_6: "Renovate Inveraray Castle"
 AYL_idea_6_desc: "The ruins of an older fortification were improved in 1743, establishing the basis of Inveraray Castle. Its Gothic architecture has stood as a foreboding reminder of Ducal power ever since - especially after the village was moved away from the castle just to give the occupants more space."
 AYL_idea_7: "Patrick MacKellar"

 FFE_idea_2: "Beware Macduff"
 FFE_idea_2_desc: "The descendants of Dubh, Mormaer of Fife, were known as Clan Macduff. One particular Mormaer is famous for joining the rebellion against King Macbeth of Alba, immortalized in Shakespeare's eponymous play. In the play, Macduff eventually kills Macbeth, fulfilling the warning - 'Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff; Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.'"
 FFE_idea_3: "Assume the Title Justiciar"
 FFE_idea_3_desc: "Many Fifian Earls simultaneously held the honorific title 'Justiciar of Scotia', the highest legal office within the kingdom. Responsibilities included supervising the realm's sheriffs and sergeants, holding court, and meeting with the King - while the privileges were innumerable."
 FFE_idea_4: "Capitalis Legis Clenmcduffe"

 FFE_idea_7: "Or a Lion Rampart Gules"
 FFE_idea_7_desc: "The only difference between the Coat of Arms of Scotland proper and of Fife is the royal addition of a flowery border. Some even theorize the royal arms are derived from Fife. Either way, the Fifian arms are a testament to its nobility."

After drifting out of the French sphere of influence, several counties emerged from it - among them, ours. The tradition of frontier defense lives on in the Catalans, who will fight fiercely against heathen neighbors."
 catducal_idea_2: "Diocese of Urgell"
 catducal_idea_2_desc: "Urgell holds its own ecclesiastical diocese, one of the most ancient in Iberia. The state of Andorra was co-ruled by the Bishops of Urgell, and many members of the comital House of Urgell held the position over the centuries. In this way, the Catalan dynasties held power even beyond their political borders."
 catducal_idea_3: "Cerdanya Laws"
 catducal_idea_3_desc: "The county of Cerdanya descended from Wilfred the Hairy and the Bellonids. Even up to the second millenium, Cerdanya maintained the legal traditions of the Carolingian Franks - Salic Law - and that of the Visigoths who preceded them. A sophisticated judicial system consisted of both Judices and Boni Homines, who presided over trials."
 catducal_idea_4: "Fortifying the Counties"
 catducal_idea_4_desc: "Enemies surround us on all sides, from the Moors lodged around the Western Mediterranean to the French dukes across the Pyrenees and even other ambitious Spanish states who would like to expand their influence over our lands. We should improve our defenses and use the mountains to our advantage."
 catducal_idea_5: "Reunite the Pallars"
 catducal_idea_5_desc: "The County of Pallars was nestled in the valleys of the Pyrenees, ensuring its survival. In 1011, upon the death of Suñer I, the county was divided between his sons into two new states, Pallars Jussà and Pallars Sobirà. With its two administrative centers reunited, local defense and tax collection would be easier."
 catducal_idea_6: "Catalan Independence"
 catducal_idea_6_desc: "With the ascession of Hugh Capet in 987, the Catalan counties refused to pay homage to the new dynasty, fostering more of a connection with their fellow Iberian states in the form of Navarra and Aragon. Over the ensuing centuries, despite the expansion of the counts of Barcelona and the Aragonese kings, many smaller Catalan counties retained their independence. Even after they were absorbed, the Catalans sought free rule and special privileges."

The narrow waterway commands trade between the whole Baltic Sea and the rest of the world, making its control invaluable. Skane is centered upon some of its most important ports, such as Lund and Malmø. We should use this to our advantage."
 SKN_idea_2: "Harald Bluetooth's Conquests"
 SKN_idea_2_desc: "Originally, Skane was made up of five tribal units or Thanedoms, consisting of disorganized farmers. The first Danish king Haraldr united the region in the tenth century, overseeing its Chriastianization. Haraldr was the greatest of Scandinavian rulers, and a great asset to the true faith. Now that we have regained our indepdendence, we Skanians should model our society after his vision!"
 SKN_idea_3: "Skanian Law"
 SKN_idea_3_desc: "Encoded at the turn of the thirteenth century, Skanian Law is the oldest provincial law code in Denmark. Within the vernacular manuscript were laws regarding property, farming, fishing, criminal justice, marriage, heritage, common land, and more. We can further cement these laws by producing a Runic edition, a 'Codex Runicus', in this most ancient language of our fathers."
 SKN_idea_4: "Found the Lund Academy"
 SKN_idea_4_desc: "In 1425 a Franciscan monastery in Lund opened a university, dubbed 'the Academy'. Though it was eventually shut down in the wake of the reformation, it contributed greatly to the scholasticism of the region. In 1666, a spiritual successor was established in the form of the Regia Academia Caroline, which continued to educate Skania's citizens."
 SKN_idea_5: "Dominium Maris Baltici"
 SKN_idea_5_desc: "Establishing a Baltic Sea Dominion over the sea's entire coastland is the goal of all Scandinavian rulers. Due to its crucial position on the borderland between Denmark and Sweden, Skania has seen many battles on land and sea, and was endlessly fought over by foreign powers. Now that we have learned from these various attempted invasions, we can realize our own aspirations of dominance."
 SKN_idea_6: "Loyal Protestants"

The union was a pact directed against the peasantry, many of whom were Romanian. This alliance would have a long lasting and unexpected impact on the history of our people."
 SZK_idea_2: "Guardians of the East"
 SZK_idea_2_desc: "The position of our lands on the easternmost border of the Carpathian mountains and across the Burzenland means the Székelys have been Hungary's frontier against the aggression of hordes and heathens. It was through these passes that the Mongols advanced in 1241, and we must ensure this never happens again."
 SZK_idea_3: "Comes Siculorum"
 SZK_idea_3_desc: "In the twelfth century the Szeklers of Transylvania were organized into a county, with its leaders appointed by the Hungarian king. This arrangement greatly benefited our people by turning us into an organized political entity, and the Kings of Hungary eventually adopted 'Count of the Szeklers' among their own titles."
 SZK_idea_4: "Cultural Melting Pot"
 SZK_idea_4_desc: "The origin of the Székely people has been long debated, but the commonly accepted explanation is that our ancestors were Magyars who mixed with Avars, Khazars, and Bolghars. Deftly handling multiple ethnicities and practices is part of our nation's ethos."
 SZK_idea_5: "Sun and Moon"

In tandem with the Teutonic Order in the Burzenland, we thus have a history of defending our homeland from foreign aggression."
 KLY_idea_3: "Diploma Andreanum"
 KLY_idea_3_desc: "The 1224 Golden Charter of the Transylvanian Saxons codified our rights and the land we would control as an autonomous entity. It was from this Royal document that we earned the name 'Royal Lands', or 'Királyföld' in Hungarian. We should reaffirm these rights given to us by András II, and seek a confirmation from the current Hungarian monarch that they will never be infringed."
 KLY_idea_4: "Restore the Kirchenburgen"
 KLY_idea_4_desc: "After the Mongols devestated our lands in the thirteenth century, our towns invested in fortified churches with massive walls. Many have fallen into disrepair over the centuries as we grew decadent under the demise of the Hordes' power. It would be foolish, however, to let a great preexisting defensive infrastructure go to waste, when there are still enemies stirring on all sides."
 KLY_idea_5: "Igrisch and Kerz"
 KLY_idea_5_desc: "We have shared a national religious identity since the earliest days of our colonization efforts, through such institutions as the 1191 Provostship of Hermannstadt. In later years, it was the Cistercian abbeys at Igrisch and Kerz which kept us united, and finally the wisdom of Johannes Honter, a Lutheran reformer who led the population in a mass conversion."
 KLY_idea_6: "The Saxon Seats"
 KLY_idea_6_desc: "Transylvanian Saxons were divided into Seats (special administrative divisions exempt from the usual comital feudal system by the King) with seven major towns - Schässburg, Mühlbach, Hermannstädt, Mediasch, Kronstadt, Klausenburg, and Bistritz. It was from these seven towns that we derived our name in many languages, such as German 'Siebenbürgen'. Administering our lands is thus quite easy compared to some states."

 wendish_idea_2_desc: "The Kingdom of Denmark is our greatest trade partner, with the Baltic Sea providing easy ship access to their southern islands. Lolland, Møn, and Falster are all littered with Wendish trading posts. Continuing this mercantile tradition is in our best interest, but some even engage in lucrative piracy."
 wendish_idea_3: "Restore Radegost"
 wendish_idea_3_desc: "It is known by various names - Rethra, Radagoszcz, Redigast... As the center of Slavic Pagan civilization, this great city and temple complex was a testament to Slavic power until the heathen crusaders destroyed it. Rebuilding must begin immediately if we are to survive as a cultural unit."
 wendish_idea_4: "The Confederations"
 wendish_idea_4_desc: "To resist foreign aggression, many Wends united together into great tribal confederations. The largest two were the Obotrites and the Liutizians, made up of such tribes as the Redarians, Tollensians, and Wagrians. This strategy of cooperation has served us well in the past, and improvements in infrastructure should allow us to take it to the next level of officiality."
 wendish_idea_5: "Wendish Crusade"
 wendish_idea_5_desc: "Our power was so threatening to the Germans that they launched a full scale Crusade against us in 1147. The greatest Kings, Dukes, and Bishops of the land needed to band together to make a dent in our defenses. Such is the bravery of our soldiers, and the resolve of our faithful!"
 wendish_idea_6: "Drvovid of the Rani"
 wendish_idea_6_desc: "The Rani, occupying the island of Rügen, were one of the most powerful Wendish tribes, and the only tribe to style their ruler as a King. Even more honored than the king, however, was the high oracle Priest, called the Drvovid. Such elevation of Church over State attests the sophistication of Wendish government structures."
 wendish_idea_7: "Ostsiedlung"
 wendish_idea_7_desc: "German can be herd throughout the Wendish cities, and Christians practice their faith throughout the lands. Though these foreign impositions may cover up our old ways of life, certain aspects will forever live on through syncretic traditions."
#Livonian

 livonian_ideas_start: "Livonian Traditions"
 livonian_ideas_bonus: "Livonian Ambitions"
 livonian_idea_1: "Varangian Trade Route"
 livonian_idea_1_desc: "The Greeks call it 'Emporike Odos Varangos-Hellenon', their main trade route with the Norse Varangians. The rivers of Livonia are a crucial part of this route, leading from the Baltic to the Kievan Rus and eventually Byzantium. We can thus exact tolls on travelers and hold an important role in Eastern geopolitics."
 livonian_idea_2: "Amber Deposits"
 livonian_idea_2_desc: "Prehistoric geological processes resulted in the Pruthenian and Livonian coasts being rich with Amber, which was at times valued even more than Gold. By expanding our collection of coastal Amber deposits, we can turn Livonia into an ecnomic powerhouse through trade down the Amber Road."
 livonian_idea_3: "Principalities of Latgalia"
 livonian_idea_3_desc: "Among the southern Livonian tribes, the Latgalians were the most advanced, holding extensive connections with the Orthodox Rus of Polotsk. Organized Christian principalities like Koknese and Jersika emerged on Latgalian land, who could deftly negotiate with European crusaders to avoid the devestation of their territories and attain mutually beneficial deals. The Latgalians would go on to form the basis of Latvia itself as they assimilated their neighboring tribes."
 livonian_idea_4: "Vikings of Curonia"
 livonian_idea_4_desc: "The Curonians were a seafaring tribe, and were considered the most restless and wealthy of the tribes, amassing great riches through naval warfare and piracy. Many considered them Baltic Vikings, as their bravery on the sea was matched by their fierceness on land."
 livonian_idea_5: "Farmlands of Semigallia"
 livonian_idea_5_desc: "Between Latgalia and Curonia lay the twin lands of the Semigallians and Selonians, known for their verdant farms and productive farmers. Wanting to continue their way of life, they were extremely resistant to the incursions of the heathen Crusaders, leading resistance under such dukes as Viestards and Nameisis."
 livonian_idea_6: "Terra Mariana"
 livonian_idea_6_desc: "After the incursions of the German crusaders, Livonia was organized into the Terra Mariana, a confederation of Crusaders, Bishoprics, and vassal tribes. Thus, even after subjugation, the Livonians remained active in the governance of the region."
 livonian_idea_7: "Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland"
 livonian_idea_7_desc: "The Enlightenment held signficant sway in later Latvia, inspiring a Latvian nationalist movement. The Baltic German author Garlieb Merkel embodied the national sentiment in his book 'Die Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland am Ende des Philosophischen Jahrhunderts: Ein Beytrag zur Völker und Menschenkunde', which explained the oppression of the Latvian serfs under foreign rule. Latvians would not tolerate the same conditions under Russian rule."

 ZMG_ideas_bonus: "Samogitian Ambitions"
 ZMG_idea_1: "Zemaiciu Alkas"
 ZMG_idea_1_desc: "The Pagan Samogitians made astrological observations from the top of Birutes Hill in Palanga. The hill was decorated with wooden structures honoring different Baltic gods - Perkunas, Aušrine, Zemyna, Austeja, Ondenis, Patrimpas, Patulas, Velnias, Leda, Saula, and Menulis. Restoring this complex will be as much a boon to our naturalists as our cultural heritage."
 ZMG_idea_2: "Palemonid Legacy"
 ZMG_idea_2_desc: "The dukes of Samogitia, starting with Borkus, founder of Jurbarkas, claim descent from the legendary Roman Palemon. According to the legend, Palemon was a relative of Nero who escaped Rome with 500 families and traveled north to the Neman. The story is a myth, and was retroactively fixed to move Palemon's death into the 900s, but we don't need to let our neighbors know that."
 ZMG_idea_3: "Medininkai"
 ZMG_idea_3_desc: "Before it was known as Varniai, our Western capital was called Medininkai, established on the banks of the Varnele river. It became the seat of the Samogitian Bishops, and remained a cultural center with such distinguished residents as Mikalojus Daukša, the first man to publish in Lithuanian within the Commonwealth Duchy."
 ZMG_idea_4: "Victory Against the Orders"
 ZMG_idea_4_desc: "Samogitia, sandwiched between the Teutonic and Livonian Order, seemed ripe for conquest - however, when the armies entered they returned decisively defeated on several occassions by the skilled Samogitian armies. One defeat at Saule in 1236 was so severe for the Livonian Brothers of the Sword that they were forced to seek protection from the Teutonic Order, effectively ending their independence."
 ZMG_idea_5: "Rooted Pagan Beliefs"
 ZMG_idea_5_desc: "Samogitia was the last great bastion of Paganism before converting to Christianity in 1413. Some populations still even worshipped the old gods up until the 1560s. Resisting conversions from outside powers is necessary for the survival of our unique culture."
 ZMG_idea_6: "Changing Political Landscape"
 ZMG_idea_6_desc: "Samogitia changed hands several times between the crusading orders and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries. However, they still kept their distinct autonomy during this period as Duke of Samogitia."
 ZMG_idea_7: "Lithuanian Cultural Revival"
 ZMG_idea_7_desc: "Despite its separation from Vilna, Samogitia was a focal point during the Lithuanian Cultural Revival, a reaction against oppressive Russian occupiers. Books in the Lithuanian language - which had been banned by the Russian Tsar - were smuggled throughout our region."

 MAF_idea_1: "Pen Rhionydd"
 MAF_idea_1_desc: "Legend holds that King Arthur had three courts in Britain - Pen Rhionydd, Celliwig, and Mynyw, with the first being his Northernmost court. We have pinpointed the location of this glorious site to our very own district of Rerigonium, next to the Rhinns."
 MAF_idea_2: "Cairns and Standing Stones"
 MAF_idea_2_desc: "While Arthur's presence in Galloway is steeped in legend, there are numerous physical remnants of those who occupied Galloway before us. The Torhousekie Stone Circle and Cairnholy are just some of the ancient ruins that dot Galloway, reassuring our people of the longevity of our state. Let no Scots or Angles lord over Gallovidians!"
 MAF_idea_3: "Gall Gaidheil"
 MAF_idea_3_desc: "Gall Gaidheil literally means 'Foreigner Gaels', attesting to the convergence of several ethnic groups in our lands. The Norse invaders have mixed with the local Celtic population."
 MAF_idea_4: "Fergus of Galloway"
 MAF_idea_4_desc: "Fergus was our greatest leader, and a statesman of considerable repute. By arranging a marriage with the Crovans, he became their agnatic progenitor, and then forged alliances with the English to stave over Scottish power. His actions, diplomatically, militarilly, and ecclesiastically, are prolific - we should all aspire to emulate him."
 MAF_idea_5: "Battle of Standard"
 MAF_idea_5_desc: "August 22nd, 1138 saw a great battle between David of Scotland and the Kingdom of England. David had invaded England at the head of a large army, and it was Galloway boys who were at the front of the first charge. Though the battle was a catastrophic failure, with nearly all of the Scottish army being wiped out, it proved the unwavering fearlessness of our troops."
 MAF_idea_6: "Castle Douglas"
 MAF_idea_6_desc: "The Douglases were invested with the Lordship of Galloway in the 1300s under Archibald the Grim. The Douglases improved Galloway's infrastructure, eventually building a familial castle from which to control the countryside. From this powerbase, they earned the moniker 'Black Douglases' and were a thorn in the side of the Royal domain."
 MAF_idea_7: "Belted Galloway"
 MAF_idea_7_desc: "Galloway is home to several unique beef breeds, including the Beltie, so named for its belt of white fur. These cows are bred for Galloway's moorlands and upland pastures, and produce a high-quality marbled beef that is the envy of all Scotland."

 SVG_ideas_bonus: "Schleswiger Ambitions"
 SVG_idea_1: "The Baltic Connection"
 SVG_idea_1_desc: "Schleswig is one of the most important regions in Northern European trade, bridging the rich Russian trade ports on the Baltic with those of the Dutch and English on the North Sea. Though some sail around the Jutland peninsula, our rivers and cities like Sønderborg and Husum facilitate quick goods transfer between different fleets."
 SVG_idea_2: "Angles, Saxons, and Jutes"
 SVG_idea_2_desc: "In antiquity and the early Medieval era, Jutland was home to a staggering amount of tribes, and was the original homeland of several of the barbarians who would go on to divide Rome. While the Angles and Saxons departed for the British Isles, the Jutes and Frisians stayed behind, keeping Schleswig as a multiethnic region to the present."
 SVG_idea_3: "Restore the Danevirke"
 SVG_idea_3_desc: "Centuries ago, our ancestors built a series of fortifications along our southern border, to keep the Germans from overrunning our territory. Though it has fallen into disrepair, the surrounding geography still acts as a bottleneck against the continent, and it would be prudent to restore this ancient bulwark in light of the Treaty of Heiligen which established our border with Charlemagne and his successors."
 SVG_idea_4: "Ties to Holstein"
 SVG_idea_4_desc: "Under the rule of the Abel dynasty, the dukes of Schleswig fostered close connections with the Germans over the border in Holstein. With these friends in high places, we can exert more of an influence within the Holy Roman Empire."
 SVG_idea_5: "Establish Condominium"
 SVG_idea_5_desc: "Condominium refers to the holding of a territory by multiple simultaneous rulers. Schleswig experienced this under the house of Oldenburg, Haderslev, and Holstein-Gottorp, fracturing into many enclaved fiefs. While this may seem damaging, it also heightened Schleswig's defense as multiple powerful houses held stakes."
 SVG_idea_6: "Archdeaconry of Haderslev"
 SVG_idea_6_desc: "In the wake of the Protestant Reformation, an autonomous archdeaconry was created at Haderslev out of the former unified diocese of Schleswig. Along with Ribe, this archdeaconry used Danish for its services as opposed to the more ubiquitous German."
 SVG_idea_7: "Land Tenure Reforms"
 SVG_idea_7_desc: "A series of reforms across the 18th and 19th centuries gradually eroded the old systems of serfdom and forced labor, culminating with the tenure reforms of 1805. At last, peasants could own their own farms, entering into Schleswig's economy."
#Pruthenia

 PTH_ideas_start: "Pruthenian Traditions"
 PTH_ideas_bonus: "Pruthenian Ambitions"
 PTH_idea_1: "Early Mercenary Armies"
 PTH_idea_1_desc: "Pruthenia relied almost exclusively on mercenaries who often lacked discipline and loyalty. That has often been the core problem with mercenary forces, if you fight only for pay, you fight only so long as you think you'll get paid. A dead man can not pay you and you can not pay him."
 PTH_idea_2: "Frederican Professional Army"
 PTH_idea_2_desc: "Elector Frederick William developed the Prussian Army into a viable standing army, while King Frederick William I of Prussia dramatically increased its size and improved its doctrines."
 PTH_idea_3: "Pruthenian Tolerance"
 PTH_idea_3_desc: "The Pruthenian Monarchs were religiously tolerant and kept civil strife within their regions to a bare minimum. This gave Pruthenia an opportunity to start the recovery from the 30-years war earlier than most other players."
 PTH_idea_4: "Rise of Pruthenian Military"
 PTH_idea_4_desc: "Pruthenia started rising in its military power around these years, and has remained militaristic and strong for the rest of its years."
 PTH_idea_5: "Noble Officers"
 PTH_idea_5_desc: "Frederick William I restricted enrollment in the officer corps to Germans of noble descent and compelled the Junkers, the Prussian landed aristocracy, to serve in the army, Although initially reluctant about the army, the nobles eventually saw the officer corps as its natural profession."
 PTH_idea_6: "Promote Native Producers"
 PTH_idea_6_desc: "While Frederick William I wanted to have a mostly native-born army, Frederick II wanted to have a mostly foreign-born army, preferring to have native Prussians be taxpayers and producers."
 PTH_idea_7: "Modernizing Pruthenia"
 PTH_idea_7_desc: "The defeat of the disorganized army during Napoleonic wars shocked the Prussian establishment, which had largely felt invincible after the Frederician victories. While Stein and Hardenberg began modernizing the Prussian state, Scharnhorst began to reform the military. He led a Military Reorganization Committee, which included Gneisenau, Grolman, Boyen, and the civilians Stein and Könen. Clausewitz assisted with the reorganization as well. Dismayed by the populace's indifferent reaction to the 1806 defeats, the reformers wanted to cultivate patriotism within the country."
#Rum
 RUM_ideas: "Ruman Ideas"
 RUM_ideas_start: "Ruman Traditions"
 RUM_ideas_bonus: "Ruman Ambitions"
 RUM_idea_1: "Third Rome"
 RUM_idea_1_desc: "Our very name, 'Rum', is derived from the old Roman Empire. After our stunning defeat of their Eastern continuation, we have become the third heir of that great title - not the barbarian pretenders of Moscow! Rome once made the transition from Paganism to Abrahamism, now it can transition to the final Abrahamic truth."
 RUM_idea_2: "Manzikert"
 RUM_idea_2_desc: "The Sultanate of Rum was born from the Battle of Manzikert, after which Suleiman ibn Qutulmish seceeded from the larger Seljuk empire. In this battle, the arrogant heathens attacked us with a much larger force, but their Frankish allies fled in cowardice, and their internal rivalries caused our steppe tactics to successfully route them. By Allah's will, the great Emperor of the Rhomaioi himself was captured."
 RUM_idea_3: "Black Sea Trade"
 RUM_idea_3_desc: "Eventually, many of Byzantium's most important Black Sea trade ports like Sinope fell to Rum. With these trade ports under our control we can strangle our rivals economically."
 RUM_idea_4: "The Crusades"
 RUM_idea_4_desc: "Our power was so great that the Byzantine Emperor had to request help from the Franks in his ongoing struggle with us. The first wave under Peter the Hermit was disorganized and we easily defeated them, but the main invasion was too large for us to handle. Regardless, we gained valuable insight into siege warfare which will benefit all Islamic states in the future."
 RUM_idea_5: "Vassal Buffer"
 RUM_idea_5_desc: "The Byzantines are often distracted by civil wars and the intrigues of their Slavic neighbors, but Persia is a wild land where dangerous empires rise and fall. By turning the states to our East into a series of buffer states, it will be much easier to defend our lands. Georgians, Armenians, Danishmends - all fall under our fold."
 RUM_idea_6: "Quell the Babai Revolt"
 RUM_idea_6_desc: "A charismatic Imam called Baba Ishak whipped the populace of Rum into a religious frenzy in the middle of the thirteenth century, spreading Sufi mysticism and proclaiming himself a messiah. It took years to suppress the outbreak, but ultimately the true faith was reaffirmed."
 RUM_idea_7: "Seed of the Beyliks"
 RUM_idea_7_desc: "Even after Mongol invasions spurred the decline and disintegration of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, its power lived on through the Turkish Beyliks which succeeded it, including the Ottomans. In a sense, Osman's world-spanning empire was a successor to that founded by Suleiman all those centuries ago."
#Morocco
 MOR_ideas: "Moroccan Ideas"

 MOR_ideas_bonus: "Moroccan Ambitions"
 MOR_idea_1: "Defenders of Al-Andalus"
 MOR_idea_1_desc: "As the most powerful state in Western Islam after the collapse of the Umayyads, it us up to us to defend Al-Andalus from the aggression of the Spanish Christians. Part of this will be consolidating our naval control and access to the Strait of Gibraltar, so we may easily move troops."
 MOR_idea_2: "Sagrajas"
 MOR_idea_2_desc: "The Battle of Sagrajas was our greatest triumph over the infidels and the key to our domination of Andalusia. It was said that the blood ran so think across the battlefield, our soldiers could barely keep their footing, earning the name az-Zallaqah - 'slippery ground'. With this glorious victory under our belts, we won't be losing our footing again."
 MOR_idea_3: "Berber Origins"
 MOR_idea_3_desc: "Native North-African Berber tribes have been the wellspring of several Moroccan dynasties. These Berbers are known for their resilience in the face of harsh desert conditions and long gaps between oases. It was the Gazzula Berber Ibn Yasin who formulated our foundational ideology of exported jihad against heathenry."
 MOR_idea_4: "Wings of Morocco"
 MOR_idea_4_desc: "The Moroccan military can be divided into two 'wings', like those of the later Golden Horde. While the horde was divided laterally, we are divided horizontally, into a South Wing based around Ghana and a North Wing based around Iberia. With such a system we can handle an empire with multiple vulnerable fronts."
 MOR_idea_5: "The Sunni Caliphate"
 MOR_idea_5_desc: "Many pretenders have adopted the title 'Kalifa' over the centuries, and still do to this day. The great Moroccan empire, with lands from inner Africa to northern Spain, is the true bearer of this coveted mantle. As Caliphs, we are the successors of Mohammed and the leaders of all the world's Muslims."
 MOR_idea_6: "Atlas Mountains"
 MOR_idea_6_desc: "Below the capital Marrakesh lies a series of steep mountain ranges known as the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas. Like their namesake, these mountains hold our Moroccan world together, as a well-defended staging ground for Almohad conquests and a shield from southern attacks."
 MOR_idea_7: "Moroccan Coinage"
 MOR_idea_7_desc: "Minting coins in the name of the current monarch is one of the greatest methods of reinforcing his legitimacy, in addition to controlling the national economy. Powerful Almohad Caliphs like Abu Yaqub Yusuf issued gold coins covered in inscriptions of piety and dynastic nobility."

 taifa_ideas_bonus: "Taifa Ambitions"
 taifa_idea_1: "Umayyads"
 taifa_idea_1_desc: "After the death of Mohammed, a succession of new Caliphates emerged to lead the faith. First came the Rashiduns, winning great victories against the Romans, and next the Umayyads, who conquered Spain from its Visigothic lords. In the 750s, a treacherous revolt resulted in the Caliphate's exile to Iberia, called Al-Andalus - the land of the Vandals. The Umayyads ruled our lands until 1031, when their final collapse caused the Taifas to emerge. We must reclaim the Umayyad legacy and reunite the Andals!"
 taifa_idea_2: "Sevillan Diplomacy"
 taifa_idea_2_desc: "The men of Seville had the most success in rapid expansion at the expense of their neighbors, due to their adept diplomatic tricks and realpolitik. The Sevillans would hire mercenaries from Muslims and Christians alike, and play their enemies against each other, even allying with heathens."
 taifa_idea_3: "Muladi and Saqaliba"
 taifa_idea_3_desc: "Slavs may seem like the last group to turn up in an Andalusian Taifa, but they were actually a significant population in the Middle Ages. Brought over as slaves, these Saqaliba sometimes worked their way up to sovereign Taifa rule. In addition, large parts of our state populations are made up of mixed ethnicities - Berbers, Arabs, and converted Iberians living and working together."
 taifa_idea_4: "Islamic Scholarship"
 taifa_idea_4_desc: "It is not in the halls of Oxford or Milan that the greatest scientists and men of healing walk, but in the halls of Andalusian mosques. From mathematics to astronomy, from anatomy to botany, citizens of our Taifas are always at the cutting edge. Ibn Rushd, Ibn Zuhr, and Khalid ibn Yazid are just some of the towering scientific figures who lived amongst the Moors."
 taifa_idea_5: "Cast off the Parias"
 taifa_idea_5_desc: "As the northern Christian kingdoms became more powerful, they began to impose a tribute called a Paria on the weakened Taifas. It is time we asserted our independence and refused to pay any tribute to domineering neighbors."
 taifa_idea_6: "Andalusian Horses"
 taifa_idea_6_desc: "As early as 450 BC, Andalusian horses were known for their prowess in warfare. Over time, the Celts, Romans, Goths, and Moors developed them further, producing the elegant and hardy breed that exists today. With such noble steeds, the armies of heathenry will not stand a chance."
 taifa_idea_7: "Restore the Cities"
 taifa_idea_7_desc: "Cordoba, Toledo, Granada, Badajoz, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza - each the center of a Taifa powerful in both political clout and cultural sophistication. We must decorate these cities with jeweled mosques and tapestries, promoting our distinctive Moorish architecture across the peninsula."
#South Slavic

 sslav_ideas_bonus: "South Slavic Ambitions"
 sslav_idea_1: "Old Church Slavonic"
 sslav_idea_1_desc: "Old Church Slavonic was the first Slavic literary language, created with the help of the Byzantine missionaries Cyril and Methodius. It is from this Cyril that the Cyrillic alphabet emerged, and from whence its Greek connections come. It was primarily used for religious purposes, and helped foster our devout conversion from our old heathenish ways."
 sslav_idea_2: "Byzantine Raids"
 sslav_idea_2_desc: "For centuries, the Southern Slavs made a living off raiding the Romans across the Danube, taking advantage of the empire's perpetual distraction. These raids soon turned into large scale settlement, and by the seventh and eighth century the Byzantines had been pushed all the way back to only their largest and most impenetrable coastal cities."
 sslav_idea_3: "Autokefalna"
 sslav_idea_3_desc: "With the weaking of Greek Patriarchal authority, many self-governing churches sprang up across the Balkans. The Bosnians, for example, separated from both Rome and Constantinople, surviving multiple Crusades and attempts by Hungary to impose Catholic rule. We must join with our Slavic brethren and establish our own autocephalous church."
 sslav_idea_4: "Adriatic Trade"
 sslav_idea_4_desc: "The Adriatic Sea opened the Slavs up to lucrative trading opportunities with Latin Italy, especially the Republic of Venice. The Venetians captured many important coastal cities, but these incursions will only boost our economic power if we take proper advantage of them."
 sslav_idea_5: "Dušanov Zakonik"
 sslav_idea_5_desc: "Dusan's Code, crafted in the 1340s by Stefan Dušan the Great, codified the laws of the Serbian Empire and its successive Serbian Despotate. As an early example of a constitution, this legal codex stands as an inspiration to all Southern Slavs. We can adopt its principles for usage in our own state."
 sslav_idea_6: "Rum Millet"
 sslav_idea_6_desc: "Under the pressure of the Ottomans, hope was found in the establishment of the Millet system. The Ottomans permitted a degree of religious self-governance, with most of the Balkan Slavs falling under the Orthodox 'Rum Millet'. We can bolster our shared cultural identity over feast days and liturgy, as the Ottomans prefer Slavic Christianity to the grasp of Rome."
 sslav_idea_7: "Nationalism"
 sslav_idea_7_desc: "In the age of Revolutions and Enlightenment, the Balkan Peninsula, and specifically the Slavs, were a hotbed of ethno-nationalism. The Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck predicted in the late 1800s that if a world war were to break it, it would be over something that happened in the Balkans."

 hunduc_idea_1_desc: "Before the era of the oligarchs, there was nevertheless a precedent for Magyar ducal rule. An entity simply known as 'The Duchy', and consisting of scattered titles throughout the kingdom, was given in appanage to relatives of the Árpád monarchs until 1107."
 hunduc_idea_2: "Rule of the Oligarchs"
 hunduc_idea_2_desc: "Upon the fall of House Árpád in 1301, ambitious nobles from around Hungary achieved de-facto independence. This period of anarchy was known as the 'Rule of the Oligarchs', or 'Tartományúr'. We must usurp as many royal prerogatives as we can if we are to keep up with the other Oligarch's states!"
 hunduc_idea_3: "Magyar Tactics"
 hunduc_idea_3_desc: "We may be quite separated from those original Magyars who brought Dacia to its knees, but their military stratagems live on within us. One more time shall the Magyar cavalries ride across the plains of Eastern Europe, exacting tribute from our cowering neighbors."
 hunduc_idea_4: "Establish Banates"
 hunduc_idea_4_desc: "The Royal realm made extensive use of buffer states along the Carpathian mountains and Danubes, establishing various semi-independent polities under the rule of an appointed 'Ban', usually from a local noble family but sometimes from the core Magyar lands. We should implement this tactic in our own lands to hold the precarious borderlands."
 hunduc_idea_5: "Cuman Settlers"
 hunduc_idea_5_desc: "Over the centuries many steppe tribes occupied the Carpathian basin, from Avars to Khabars to our own Magyars. As the Cumans moved westward under the threat of Mongol invasion, they were offered organized settlement opportunities by the Hungarians. By letting them settle we will increase our fighting population."
 hunduc_idea_6: "Magyarországi Református Egyház"
 hunduc_idea_6_desc: "The Synod of Debrecen in 1567 issued a Helvetic Confession, seeding Calvinism throughout Hungary. Separated from Rome by the Ottoman Empire, and alienated by an aloof Austrian aristocracy, this adoption of Reformed faith reunited the drifting Magyar populations."
 hunduc_idea_7: "1848 Revolution"
 hunduc_idea_7_desc: "As the fire of revolution swept across Europe in 1848, Hungary was not spared, and the entire former Kingdom declared its independence from Austria. In this spirit of national pride and self-rule, we must be unwavering in the face of further foreign imperialists, like Lajos Kossuth and Artúr Görgei."

 walduc_idea_1: "We Were Romans"
 walduc_idea_1_desc: "In AD 106 Trajan conquered the Dacians and subsumed the trans-Danubian region into the Empire. Though the Romans later retreated, their Latin tongue has lived on amongst the Vlach peoples. It is from this direct line that Vlachs would later go on to take the name 'Romania'."
 walduc_idea_2: "Radu Negru"
 walduc_idea_2_desc: "Often connected with Basarab I, Radu Negru is the legendary founder of the Wallachian Principality at the turn of the fourteenth century, ending the dominance of the Hungarian Voivodes. We must aspire to unite Wallachia under one banner as Radu is said to have done."
 walduc_idea_3: "Battle of Posada"
 walduc_idea_3_desc: "The enormous Kingdom of Hungary attempted to subjugate the Wallachian people in the 1300s, sending 30,000 troops with King Charles at the head. A tiny force of cavalry and local peasants met the challenge, crushing the Hungarian army in a devestating ambush. This decisive victory engenders our national ethos."
 walduc_idea_4: "Order of the Dragon"
 walduc_idea_4_desc: "The Order of the Dragon was a noble organization founded by King Sigismund of Hungary, and modeled after the old Crusading orders. Many prominent Vlachs were members of the order, and it inspired the name of the house Draculesti. The Draculesti and Danesti voivodes would dominate Wallachia for centuries."
 walduc_idea_5: "Boyar Compromises"
 walduc_idea_5_desc: "Boyars are the Vlach nobility, and their interference in politics was a constant threat. By coming to a compromise with them, allowing certain rights and privileges, we can focus on internal stability. This model was used by Radu IV to great effect, making his principality the envy of the other Romanian states."
 walduc_idea_6: "Curtea de Arges Cathedral"
 walduc_idea_6_desc: "Dedicated to Saint Nicholas, this cathedral was inspired by Byzantine and Islamic architecture and remains an impressive icon of Wallachian Orthodoxy."
 walduc_idea_7: "Reorganize the Counties"
 walduc_idea_7_desc: "Wallachia has long been divided into major regions such as Oltenia and Muntenia. We should break down and redraw our administrative divisions to allow for a more smooth management of the Vlach lands and local minorities."

 marches_idea_1_desc: "Offa's Dyke was built by an Anglo-Saxon king of Mercia centuries ago. The earthworks now establish the border between Wales and England - the same border we have bravely ventured out over."
 marches_idea_2: "Appointed by England"
 marches_idea_2_desc: "The land conquered from the native Welsh petty kings has been organized into Earldoms, with each Earl invested by the King of England into a hereditary position. With the backing of the most powerful force in the British Isles, we too can dominate the political landscape of these strange Celtic lands."
 marches_idea_3: "Sicut Regale Rulers"
 marches_idea_3_desc: "Compared to normal English fiefs, we have extensive freedoms. Royal Writ does not apply in our frontier holdings, and we instead rule 'sicut regale' - 'ling a king'. We can build our own castles, administer laws, declare wars, establish Market Towns, maintain our own chanceries, confiscate lands, hold trials, and appoint our own sheriffs."
 marches_idea_4: "Roger Mortimer"
 marches_idea_4_desc: "Roger Mortimer was the most powerful of the Marcher Lords, holding exensive allodial titles across Wales and Ireland. He became so powerful, he effectively ruled England in tandem with his mistress Isabella - the wife of the English King Edward II. Eventually, Edward's son built up enough support to wrestle back control of his kingdom from Mortimer, and had him executed, sparing his mother's life. Ironic - he could save others from death, but not himself."
 marches_idea_5: "Foreign Settlers"
 marches_idea_5_desc: "It was not just the Anglo-Normans who conquered and settled South Wales. Many invested Earls were brought directly from mainland France, but also from Brittany and Flanders. Our lands are thus comprised of a coalition of foreign and domestic populations, each with their unique strengths they provide to the state."
 marches_idea_6: "Geoffrey of Monmouth"
 marches_idea_6_desc: "He who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the present, controls the past. Geoffrey of Monmouth is the greatest of our Cambro-Norman historians, famous for his work on Arthurian legend. Historia Regum Britanniae remains the definitive work on the history of our realm."
 marches_idea_7: "Council of Wales"
 marches_idea_7_desc: "Edward IV needed to properly administer Wales even long after his eponymous ancestor's conquests. In 1472 he established the Council of Wales and the Marches, a regional governing body originally headed by important Bishops. Wales thus had a degree of internal governance far beyond its integration."
#Polish Ducal
 polduc_ideas: "Polish Ducal Ideas"
 polduc_ideas_start: "Polish Ducal Traditions"
 polduc_ideas_bonus: "Polish Ducal Ambitions"
 polduc_idea_1: "Testament of Boleslaw Wrymouth"
 polduc_idea_1_desc: "The 1138 will of Boleslaw III, called 'Wrymouth' for his deformed jaw, divided the recently-strengthened Kingdom of Poland amongst his sons. It was from this division that all polish Duchies emerged, setting in motion centuries of internal conflicts and intrigues. We owe our existence to Boleslaw's vision."
 polduc_idea_2: "Ethnic Backgrounds"
 polduc_idea_2_desc: "Before the unification of Poland into one Christian state, there were Slavic tribal units in its present lands. The Silesians, Mazovians, Vistulans, Polans, and Pomeranians were the main powers, and they each live on now in the names of our duchies. Though the distinctions have blurred, we are essentially nominal ethnostates."
 polduc_idea_3: "The Seniorate"
 polduc_idea_3_desc: "Boleslaw's testament didn't just divide Poland - it decreed a system of hierarchy, with one province centered on Kraków known as the 'Seniorate', as it was always ruled by the oldest heir and had nominal suzerainty of the other states. To push our interests, we could perhaps bend these rules and find some claim to senior privileges ourselves."
 polduc_idea_4: "Ties With the Germans"
 polduc_idea_4_desc: "Poland's interaction with the German Holy Roman Empire was extensive, though obviously strongest in the east and south. The Silesian duchies entered into a vassal relationship with Bohemia, while the Pomeranians joined the Empire as well under the influence of Brandenburg. These ties mean our royal houses have extensively intermarried, and our trade relations are tight."
 polduc_idea_5: "Divide for Appanage"
 polduc_idea_5_desc: "After the original division of Poland, the sub-duchies were again divided into even smaller territories. Kujavia emerged from Mazovia, Greater Poland produced Kalisz, Gniezno, and various smaller states. In the end, the smaller dukes had less power projection but could more closely administer their lands."
 polduc_idea_6: "Magdeburg Law"
 polduc_idea_6_desc: "The Magdeburg Laws were perhaps the most important in medieval European administration, dealing with the autonomy and rights of individual cities. Under these laws, Poland was urbanized with more modern infrastructure and thousands of villages were founded. Even major pre-existing cities like Poznan benefited from the introduction of these laws."
 polduc_idea_7: "Janusz Mazowiecki"
 polduc_idea_7_desc: "Janusz III was the last of the Piast dukes to rule in Poland before being subsumed into the Royal realm. Despite his death, the duchy retained autonomy under its rebellious nobles under 1576, when it was fully integrated by the Jagiellons. We must ensure that our state maintains its own freedoms, and that ambitious Kings will not bend us to their will."

 EPI_ideas_bonus: "Epirote Ambitions"
 EPI_idea_1: "Pyrrhos"
 EPI_idea_1_desc: "In the third century BC, a Molossian king called Pyrrhos ascended to the kingship of Epirus and led it to great victories. He made the Epirote state so strong it rivaled Rome itself, leading multiple attacks against this rival republic. He is remembered in the term 'Pyrrhic Victory', which denotes a win at great cost - the type of win Epirus will always be willing to achieve when necessary."
 EPI_idea_2: "Empire of the Angeloi"
 EPI_idea_2_desc: "When Constantinople fell in 1204, not all of the Byzantine Empire's lands were conquered by the Latins. The three main areas remaining under Greek control - Epirus, Nikaea, and Trebizond - each declared themselves the legitimate successors to the defunct state. It is only our Angelid 'Komnenos-Doukas' dynasty that has an actual legitimate claim, from Isaac in 1185 all the way up to the murdered Alexios Mourtzouphlos. We will avenge Mourtzouphlos and restore the Empire's rightful heirs!"
 EPI_idea_3: "The Second Noah"
 EPI_idea_3_desc: "Many displaced Greeks from around the Aegean have been welcomed to the benevolent realm of Epirus over the years. Our founder was even described as a 'Second Noah', taking in refugees from the Latin flood. Though Latins eventually held their own influence in Epirus, this open embracement of new citizens has remained."
 EPI_idea_4: "Arvanites"
 EPI_idea_4_desc: "Arvanites were a type of Hellenized Albanians who first lived around Himara and Argyrokastro before migrating to Thebes and Attica. Since the Serbian Empire, Albanians established their own states in the Epirote region, holding court at such cities as Arta. These Albanians were known for their ferocity, mercilessly attacking Greeks, Latins, and Turks alike."
 EPI_idea_5: "The Last Franks"
 EPI_idea_5_desc: "The port of Vonitsa was finally lost to the Turks in 1479 after decades of clinging on. With its fall, the last remnants of the Frankokratia established over 250 years earlier were finally erased, barring a handful of Venetian ports. We were first among Greeks, and last among Latins."
 EPI_idea_6: "Ionian Islands"
 EPI_idea_6_desc: "As the lords of the Ionian coast, we have extensive connections to the islands of Cephalonia, Zakynthos, and Kerkyra, and command trade between mainland Greece and southern Italy around the Strait of Otranto. The influence of Epirus over these islands was so great their Orsini lords converted to Orthodoxy and adopted Greek customs to appeal to us."
 EPI_idea_7: "Souliote Revolutions"
 EPI_idea_7_desc: "The Souliotes inspired some of the fiercest revolutions against Ottoman rule in Greek history, such as the 1685 Himaran revolt and the mid-1700s Ottoman subjugation attempts in which army after army were destroyed. Their 1770 Orlov revolt presaged the Greek War of Independence, and even after the nation had won its freedom, the Epirote people revolted one final time in 1854."
#Wied
 WDX_ideas: "Wieder Ideas"
 WDX_ideas_start: "Wieder Traditions"
 WDX_ideas_bonus: "Wieder Ambitions"
 WDX_idea_1: "The Peacock"
 WDX_idea_1_desc: "The Counts of Wied used the peacock as their coat of arms. Peacocks ar known for their beautiful plumage and symbolise pride and vanity. The name Wied comes from the nearby Wied river. The castle of the early Counts of Wied, Burg Altwied, had never been conquered. The Counts also were used to leading their troops, having fought in battles to protect the Empire."
 WDX_idea_2: "Keep Good Relations with the Palatinate"
 WDX_idea_2_desc: "The Counts of Wied had always had good relations with the Pfalzgraves, as they had long been fiefs, and even thereafter the Palatinate continued to support Wied. This lead to numerous advantages, like receiving Ledigmann as a vassal."
 WDX_idea_3: "Das Recht auf weitgehende Religionsfreiheit"
 WDX_idea_3_desc: "In order to attract more inhabitants to the slow-growing newly-founded city of Neuwied, the Count gave the city in a charter numerous freedoms, including the right to elect their Magistrate or to collect taxes, but most exceptionally for that time, the right to a broad religous freedom. Many people fled from other counties to Neuwied due to relgious intolerance. In the 18th century, seven different religious communities lived in Neuwied: Calvinists, Lutherans, Catholics, Mennonites, Inspirationalists, Herrnhuters and Jews."
 WDX_idea_4: "Wetzlarer Punctation"
 WDX_idea_4_desc: "At a certain moment there was a dispute about the municipal revenues between the Count and the Magistrate. Before the trial was finished, an acceptable compromise was made. In the Wetzlarer Punctation, not only were the financial disputes solved, but also the religious and other freedoms were reconfirmed."
 WDX_idea_5: "City of Schools"
 WDX_idea_5_desc: "The Counts of Wied recognized the value of education and encouraged education to the best of their ability. Already in 1616, an edict was issued, which ordened compulsory schooling in the County. Since then Wied has always been a very important center of education with it's numerous schools."
 WDX_idea_6: "Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied"
 WDX_idea_6_desc: "Prince Alexander Philipp Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied as an explorer, ethnologist and naturaliest. He explored southeast Brazil and the Great Plains. He is most important for his correct depictions and detailed descriptions, mainly about the Brazilian tribes. But he also collected a large number of specimens of flora and fauna, still preserved in a museum. Several plants and animals are named after him."
 WDX_idea_7: "An Early Industrialization"
 WDX_idea_7_desc: "The immigrants, persecuted in other places, brought in many new production goods and skills, giving Wied an economic prosperity and contributed to a comparatively early industrialization. The furniture and watches produced in Neuwied were higly demanded by other courts. But also steel was a very important export product: it was for example used to build the first German railroad.\nGoods Produced:§G +0.15"
#Passau

 PAA_ideas_start: "Passauer Traditions"
 PAA_ideas_bonus: "Passauer Ambitions"
 PAA_idea_1: "Sieben Künische Dörfen"
 PAA_idea_1_desc: "The villages of Wollaberg, Heindlschlag, Hintereben, Jandelsbrunn, Rosenberg, Aßberg and Grund, together with the area of Wilderranna, formed a large enclave and important foothold in the Austrian lands. The Bishops of Passau frequently founded new vallages, expanding their territory and influence. Much later, when most of the Passauer land was lost due to the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the bishops only held some villages they once founded in Bohemia."
 PAA_idea_2: "Not Suitable for Large Armies"
 PAA_idea_2_desc: "Invading armies had difficulties camping in Passau, as the small territory was not rich in food resources, so the resources could easily get exhausted. And if the troops were badly provisioned, they would get hungry even before fall."
 PAA_idea_3: "Confluence of the Inn and the Danube"
 PAA_idea_3_desc: "Passau was located at the confluence of the Inn and the Danube, and because of that it was an important trade city, as it linked the German and Austrian trade. But also the Ilz river is very close, providing a link to the Bohemian lands."
 PAA_idea_4: "Salzfertiger"
 PAA_idea_4_desc: "When laws regulating the salt trade were drawn by Bishop Otto, he ruled that salt which was transported on the Inn had to be stored and offered for sale in Passau for at least three days and it went through several processing stations there which were in the hands of businessmen called Salzfertiger who ran the large warehouses for the salt storage. These merchants established a powerful monopoly against their competition from Bohemia and Austria. After the three days and the customs clearance, the salt could continue its way toward the north and east. The trade route from Passau to Bohemia was one of the Golden Paths. Some salt which arrived from the Inn, Salza and Danube was transported from Passau on the water route upstream to Regensburg and downstream to Vienna."
 PAA_idea_5: "Wall-Pillar Churches"
 PAA_idea_5_desc: "These type of churches already existed, but were rarely used and often only for small churches or as parts of larger buildings. The crucial breakthrough in the creation of the wall-pillar church took place mainly in Passau, as they wanted to erect a lot more churches to impress their rival Salzburg. Wall-pillar churches allowed relatively large, wide areas to be build cheaply and quickly  from bricks or rumble."
 PAA_idea_6: "Frequent Visitations of Discipline"
 PAA_idea_6_desc: "More than in other bishoprics, Passau carried many visitations of discipline, life and morals."
 PAA_idea_7: "Reduction of the Old Diocese of Passau"
 PAA_idea_7_desc: "The Diocese of Passau is much older than the neighboring dioceses, as Passau can be considered as the successor of the ancient Roman diocese of Lorch. It was also on of the earliest states to gain princely powers.\n\nWe are, or to be more correct, were the largest diocese of the Holy Roman Empire, stretching even into Hungary, but the Pope, Austria Bavaria and all the other neighbors don't seem to care about us, and just took away much of our influence to create more dioceses like Vienna. We should solve this militarily."

 SLZ_idea_1: "Hallein Salt Mine"
 SLZ_idea_1_desc: "The Hallein Salt Mine, also known as Salzbergwerk Dürrnberg, is an underground salt mine located in the Dürrnberg plateau. The mine has been worked for over 7,000 years since the time of the Celtic tribes and earlier. It helped ensure nearby Salzburg would become a powerful trading community, even it's name comes from this mined resource."
 SLZ_idea_2: "Experiences of the Fights against the Magyars"
 SLZ_idea_2_desc: "Salzburg fought difficult wars against the Magyars, who were troublesome to stop. Eventually these invaders were pushed back. We have learned many tactics from these wars, and will perform even better in the future."
 SLZ_idea_3: "Missionary Missions Give Territory"
 SLZ_idea_3_desc: "We should invest more in missionary missions, as we can possibly gain more territory that way, like during the missionary missions in the region between the Raba, Danube and Drava rivers. At the end of these missions, a dispute arose between us and Aquileia about the borders, and the Emperor fixed the issue in our advantage!"
 SLZ_idea_4: "Primas Germaniae"
 SLZ_idea_4_desc: "The Primas Germaniae is a title of honor for the msot important Roman Catholic bishop in the German Lands. Mainz was the firt to have this title. Many other also claimed the title, like we, however, they all lost the Primate dignity, leaving us alone to bear this title!"
 SLZ_idea_5: "Convert or Leave"
 SLZ_idea_5_desc: "Protestant tendencies revealed themselves vigorously in the Bishopric, supported and promoted by the Protestant members of the imperial estates. In imitation of the Corpus evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 persons left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Würtemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."
 SLZ_idea_6: "Patrons of World-Famous Musicians"
 SLZ_idea_6_desc: "The Bishops of Salzburg were famed for their patronage of many classical writers. The most famous musicians they ever supported were Mozart and Haydn."
 SLZ_idea_7: "Second-Hand Trade"
 SLZ_idea_7_desc: "The Salzburger government did not give attach importance to the complaints of several traders about the reselling of used items causing unfair competition. These lax laws, together with the already large commercial importance, made of Salzburg an important center of second-hand trade. It remained unregulated for almost a whole existence of the Salzburger State."

 DDD_idea_1: "Founded by Henri the Lion"
 DDD_idea_1_desc: "The origins of the County go back to the middle of the 12th century, when Henri the Lion founded the five counties of Holstein, Ratzeburg, Schwerin, Dannenberg and Lüchow during the Ostsiedlung or the colonization of the East, from the mouth of the River Elbe to the southern border of the March of Brandenburg, in order to protect the new regions and borders of his territory. The lion in the coat of arms probably refers to this past."
 DDD_idea_2: "Waldemarturm"
 DDD_idea_2_desc: "It is said that the Danish king Valdemar II and his son were captured and held as prisoners in a tower of the town of Dannenberg. This tower received the name of Waldemarturm because of that."
 DDD_idea_3: "The Jeetzel River"
 DDD_idea_3_desc: "The Jeetzel River has the tendancy to frequently flood the town of Dannenberg. This caused the town to have a small and stretched shape, but it also provided defence against attackers, as the castle was build close to it."
 DDD_idea_4: "Sankt-Johannis-Kirche"
 DDD_idea_4_desc: "The Saint-John's church of Dannenberg is one of the few old buildings it has, dating from 1385, although it has been renovated many times. Just like nearly everyone converted to protestantism, this church became a protestant one."
 DDD_idea_5: "Elbtalaue"
 DDD_idea_5_desc: "Dannenberg is the most important town of the Elbtalaue, which means Elbe Valley. It's a spatially not sharply defined region around the river's middle reaches in northern Germany. It has many lakes and marshlands."
 DDD_idea_6: "The Fire of 1608"
 DDD_idea_6_desc: "In 1608, a major fire struck the town of Dannenberg, destroying all buildings except for teh church and the Waldemarturm. There are no buildings left from before the 17th century. This however cleared up space for newer and better buildings."
 DDD_idea_7: "Sold, Recovered and Lost Again"
 DDD_idea_7_desc: "In the early 14th century, the Duke of Dannenberg sold it's County to Lüneburg, ending it's existence. In the middle of the 16th century however, some members of a sideline of the Dannenberg family managed to regain power over a slightly larger independant Dannenberg. But this line soon became extinct in the middle of the 17th century, endig it's existence again and going back to Lünebrug."

 DXS_idea_1_desc: "These two local saints were the founders of the Abbey of Disentis. Sigisbert was a wandering Frankish monk, and Placidus was the local landowner who supported Sigisbert. The ruler of Chur, distrusting the two, murdered Placidus to prevent a loss of land. It did not help: Disentis became independant and controlled a very large estate. It is also one of the oldest monasteries of Southern Germany and Switzerland."
 DXS_idea_2: "Quick Mountain Movement"
 DXS_idea_2_desc: "The troops of Disentis were able to surprise attacking enemies with their rapidity. Even though they were greatly outnumbered, Disentis was able to do remarkable damage."
 DXS_idea_3: "Trons"
 DXS_idea_3_desc: "Near the secluded village of Trons, somewhere in it's thick forests, the best and most hardy men of the surroundings assembled to talk about justice, the love for liberty and humanity. The Abbot favored them with advice and his authority."
 DXS_idea_4: "Lukmanier Pass"
 DXS_idea_4_desc: "The monastery was often the site of hard-fought battles because of it's strategic location on a mountain pass, connecting the Leagues to the rest of Switzerland."
 DXS_idea_5: "Founding Member of the Grey League"
 DXS_idea_5_desc: "In an act to stop internal wars and to focus more on defending against expanding empires, the many rulers of the Grischa region formed the Grey League. Disentis had an important role in it's formation, and would become a very important member."
 DXS_idea_6: "Revert Trade Away From Gothard"
 DXS_idea_6_desc: "In the tenth century, Disentis controlled the most important passage in a large area. However, the Gothard route was laid, and the a lot of the traders went through that route instead of going through Disentis. This marked the end of our prosperity. We should change that and let the trade again go through Disentis."
 DXS_idea_7: "Bibla da Cuera"
 DXS_idea_7_desc: "Disentis used it's printing press to spread Romansh spiritual litterature, and they also made the first Catholic Romansh Bible, the Bibla da Cuera. Disentis became the cultural center of the Catholic Romansh people."

It's the Archbishop of Mainz who calls the electors together for an election, who accepts the new Emperor and exercises control over the Reichstag archives. He was formally the most important member of the Reichstag."
 MAI_idea_2: "Primas Germaniae"
 MAI_idea_2_desc: "The Primas Germaniae was a historical title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic Bishop in the German lands. Many were unsuccessful in claiming the title, but after the Secularization in 1802, Salzburg was able to claim and hold it.\nInterestingly enough, this importance was also reflected in another title: in the Catholic world, there are only two Holy Sees: the Vatican Holy See and the Holy See of Mainz."
 MAI_idea_3: "Large Military Household"
 MAI_idea_3_desc: "The Archbishop of Mainz maintained one of the largest military households among the ecclesiastical magnates in Medieval Germany. For the Indiculus Loricatorum, a reinforcement consisting of heavy knights requested by Otto II for his campaign in Italy, Mainz gave one of the highest number of cavalrymen, even if they had already sent many. However, the military importance of the Mainzer army had severly declined in modern times."
 MAI_idea_4: "Old Roman Road Network"
 MAI_idea_4_desc: "Mainz lays at the confluence of the Rhine and the Main Rivers, two major transportation corridors, granting Mainz a position as major river port. Starting from the Roman times, Mainz was an important place regarding connections by road, having branches towards Trier and Metz.\nIn modern times, it held an even more important position, as it also controlled the roads between Madgeburg, Saxony, Hessen and Franconia, and thus secured the route from Pomerania into central Germany. It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."
 MAI_idea_5: "Brand zu Mainz"
 MAI_idea_5_desc: "Mainz held an important position in Rheingau region, which is regarded as one of the best vineyard areas of the Empire, and much of this wine passed through Mainz. The town further also lays in a fertiel territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being retransported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."
 MAI_idea_6: "Mainz Diocesan Feud"
 MAI_idea_6_desc: "After a close election, the Archbishop of Mainz was not recognized by the Pope, who appointed his contender. This eventually became an armed conflict. This war had ravaged the Mainzer lands and caused the end of the existence of the Imperial City of Mainz. The Bishop appointed by the Pope had won the war."
 MAI_idea_7: "Absolute Electors and the Cathedral Chapter"
 MAI_idea_7_desc: "The Elector and the cathedral chapter were many times trying to limit each other's power, causing a real dualism. In practice, the Elector had a slight upper hand, as many had to follow him to not lose their position, and thus people tended to obey more to the Elector than to the cathedral chapter.\nOn the other hand, the Elector and the cathedral chapter were mostly of the same social class, and thus of the same interest group. The Electors had an domestic interest in assigning as many relatives as possible in the chapter to stabilize the government, as one of them would have a high chance to becoem the next Elector.\nBut during the age of absolutism, the Electors, especially the enlightened ones, seeked and managed to gain more power."

 TUB_idea_4: "In Debt to Monasteries"
 TUB_idea_4_desc: "The Counts Palatine of Tübingen founded many monasteries, the most notable being the abbeys of Bebenhausen and of Blaubeuren. But several factors contributed to an economic decline of the county, most importantly due to their extravagant donations to the monasteries they founded. To gain time to pay off his debts to Bebenhausen Abbey, the control of Böblingen and Calw were transferred to the abbey. An Imperial City, in a sign of gratitude, paid of his debts  and so he regained control. But other members of the family were also heavily indebted. Eventually the most important territories were or sold (like the city of Tübingen) or donated to Bebenhausen Abbey, ending the existence of the County."
 TUB_idea_5: "Under Württemberger Rule"
 TUB_idea_5_desc: "For centuries Tübingen had been under the rule of the Duchy of Württemberg. This had some side-effects, like converting early to Protestantism, being dragged into the many wars of the Duchy, or serving as military base."
 TUB_idea_6: "Ebenhard Karls University"
 TUB_idea_6_desc: "One of the most significant event in Tübingen's history is the founding of the Ebenhard Karls University by Duke Ebenhard of Württemberg in 1477, making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe. It became soon renowed as one of the most influential places of learning in the Holy Roman Empire, especially for Theology. A Protestant faculty followed later."
 TUB_idea_7: "Allgemeine Zeitung"
 TUB_idea_7_desc: "In 1798 the Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading newspapeer in early 19th-century Germany, was founded in Tübingen.

As experts we are often called to decide controversial questions regarding the Magddeburg Rights. These rights contain various trade and merchant rights, marital laws, the abolition of kin liability and the installation of a tribunal."
 MAG_idea_2: "Bread House of the Hansa"
 MAG_idea_2_desc: "Beginning from the 13th century, Magdeburg was part of the Hansa and a pivotal centre of trade at the Elbe. Also because of the staple right for corn, Magdeburg monopolised the corn trade making it the 'Bread House of the Hansa'."

 MAG_idea_4_desc: "The archbishops of Magdeburg held the title of a Primas Germaniae since a papal bull from 986. Although, there are others holding this title, too, we are the only ones to have adopted the new religious teachings. Therefore, we should use our title to become the forefront of this movement and impose our supremacy!"
 MAG_idea_5: "Risen from Ruins"
 MAG_idea_5_desc: "Our land and city was completly devastated during the so called Magdeburg Wedding by our intolerant opponents. This coined the phrase Magdeburgisation for such a terror.

 MAG_idea_6_desc: "Since we have dissolved Magdeburg's Abbey of St. Augustine and made the latter's library publically accessible for our citizens, the pursuit of knowledge has become a goal of a lot of burghers. One example is Otto von Guericke who made an impressive experiment showing how air pressure works and giving another proof for the existence of vacua. To do so, he connected two airtight half spheres and evacuated the hollow space inbetween with a pump. Thereafter, eight horses on each side weren't able to pull apart the sphere; only after air flowed in again were the horses able to do so."

Although, this excludes nobles, during the past and especially during wars, we charged and prosecuted even our noble enemies. Some may say this to be insane, but for us it represents our independence and juristic understanding that common nobles are not better than our free city. Both are represented through our sigil with the red castle, the Rothenburg, and the court arbor for our right to high justice."
 ROE_idea_2: "Landkauf"
 ROE_idea_2_desc: "During the reign of mayor Heinrich Toppler at the end of the 14th century, the territory of Rothenburg dramatically increased. This was achieved by systematically acquiring castles, forests and villages from impoverished nobles whose downfall sometimes was even orchestrated by the city council. Although this lead to the formation of a coalition, the council of Rothenburg was able to secure the gained land, but thereafter new acquisitions had to be restrained. However decades after these events, the moment is at hand to continue with Rothenburg's expansion!"
 ROE_idea_3: "Rothenburger Landhege"
 ROE_idea_3_desc: "After our huge land acquisitions, we have to protect them from looting and from our enemies. Therefore, we will construct moats and walls, plant impenetrable hedges and let them maintained by experts called Hegemeister.

Impressed by the size of the steins, Tilly made a joking comment that he would pardon the council members if one of them was able to empty the one of the steins in one gulp. As the former mayor Nusch was able to do so, Tilly fullled his joking promise and pardoned the city. Although, this event was unique, it teaches us that drunken generals and soldiers are less inclined to pillage and conquer our city. Therefore if the situation ever arises, we will make hostile armies drunk to the boot."

 SIE_ideas_bonus: "Sienese Ambitions"
 SIE_idea_1: "Remember Montaperti!"
 SIE_idea_1_desc: "During the Guelph-Ghibelline conflict, neighboring Florence was our arch-rival. In September of 1260, tensions came to a head and a battle was fought - the bloodiest in medieval Italy. With the help of a German ambush party we routed the Florentines despite having half as many troops, killing thousands of them and capturing the rest. To this day, the Sienese cry 'remember Montaperti!' at sporting events."
 SIE_idea_2: "Studium Senese"
 SIE_idea_2_desc: "The University of Siena was founded in the middle of the thirteenth century, making it one of the oldest in Europe, and the first to be publicly funded. Due to generous grants from Pope Innocent IV and successive Podestàs, it became a prosperous center of learning, teaching Latin, Logic, Law, and Medicine."
 SIE_idea_3: "Bancaria"
 SIE_idea_3_desc: "Siena's riches in the middle ages were often tied to its banks. From 1287 to 1355 the city was directly ruled by prominent banker families, a period which came to be called the 'Noveschi'. Under this mercantile guidance, the city reached the apex of its power and stability."
 SIE_idea_4: "Dieci, Undici, Dodici"
 SIE_idea_4_desc: "Before and after the Noveschi period, the citizenry of Siena organized the city into a council of nobles, though these proved to be short-lived and were continually replaced by different groups. First came the ventiquattro (twenty-four), then the trentasei (thirty-six), the quindici (fifteen), the dodici (twelve), the dieci (ten), and the undici (eleven). Siena is used to rapidly adapting to new circumstances of government."
 SIE_idea_5: "Piazza del Campo"
 SIE_idea_5_desc: "The Piazza del Campo is the jewel of our city, known for being one of the most beautiful public spaces in Europe. In 1419 Jacopo della Quercia added the Fonte Gaia (fountain of the world), decorated with a Madonna and representation of classical virtues, which entertains the many citizens who congregate in the piazza for commerce and celebratory events such as the bi-annual Palio di Siena horse race."
 SIE_idea_6: "Pandolfo Petrucci"
 SIE_idea_6_desc: "As with many Italian city-states, Siena was home to strongmen who attempted to rule as tyrants. One of these was Pandolfo Petrucci, who in the fifteenth century managed to seize total control of the Republic and became a 'benevolent dictator'. Petrucci strengthened the declining state and spurred a renaissance of arts and science. Though Petrucci's sons squandered his hard-fought advances, his legacy lives with the city."
 SIE_idea_7: "Government in Exile"
 SIE_idea_7_desc: "When the treacherous Spaniards and Florentines finally conquered the Sienese Republic, 700 important families continued to resist the invaders as a rump-state exiled in Montalcino. They held out for several years before the overwhelming enemy forces finally crushed them, a testament to the morale of the Sienese people."
#Ferraran
 FER_ideas: "Ferraran Ideas"
 FER_ideas_start: "Ferraran Traditions"
 FER_ideas_bonus: "Ferraran Ambitions"
 FER_idea_1: "Po Lagoons"
 FER_idea_1_desc: "The traditional lands of Ferrara were originally swamps and lagoons created by the Po river delta. Though the lagoons were eventually reclaimed, the natural salt pans surrounding them were a source of wealth for the inhabitants of our state for centuries."
 FER_idea_2: "Casa d'Este"
 FER_idea_2_desc: "In 1146 the death of Guglielmo Adelardi caused Ferrara to come into the possession of the lords of Este, who were, in fact, a cadet branch of the famous Welf dynasty - namesakes of the Guelphs. These prestigious origins are reflected in the fortunes of our ruling family, who came to inherit Modena and Reggio."
 FER_idea_3: "Papal Fief"
 FER_idea_3_desc: "Though Ferrara was first created a Duchy by the Holy Roman Emperor, in 1471 it was also reconfirmed in its ancient status as a Papal Fief by Pope Paul II. The then-ruler, Borso, agreed to pay yearly tribute to the Pope and recognize him as his liege lord in return for the recognition of his Ducal status."
 FER_idea_4: "Ercole d'Este"
 FER_idea_4_desc: "The greatest of the Ferraran Dukes was undoubtedly Ercole I, who ruled from 1471 to 1505. Nicknamed 'The Diamond' and 'North Wind', he was a consistent supporter of the arts and culture. Ferrara became one of the most attractive cities in Europe for aspiring painters, composers, writers, and architects, forging connections with Flemish painters and figures like Biagio Rossetti and Antoine Brumel."
 FER_idea_5: "Concerto delle Donne"
 FER_idea_5_desc: "Translating to 'consort of ladies', this group of virtuosa singers consisted of Laura Peverara, Anna Guarini, and Livia d'arco. They continued the innovative artistic tradition started by Ercole, and were significant in improving the standing of female singers in general."
 FER_idea_6: "Renovation"
 FER_idea_6_desc: "Later in its history, Ferrara was rocked by a series of earthquakes which leveled half the city and destroyed many of the most important buildings. The constant aftershocks were so severe they resulted in a phenomenon known as 'soil liquefaction'. With all this damage, we must attempt to restore the glory of Ferrara, and fund a new earthquake observatory to prevent a disaster like this from striking again in the future."
 FER_idea_7: "Castel Tedaldo"
 FER_idea_7_desc: "At the southwest corner of Ferrara lay an ancient castle known as Tedaldo. In the 1600s, it was improved by the Papacy, and remained the most significant bastion of the region until its dismantling by the newborn Kingdom of Italy in 1859. Even in its destruction, it continued to serve Ferrara as the bricks were used in various new constructions."
#Montferrat
 MFA_ideas: "Montferrino Ideas"
 MFA_ideas_start: "Montferrino Traditions"
 MFA_ideas_bonus: "Montferrino Ambitions"
 MFA_idea_1: "Aleramici"
 MFA_idea_1_desc: "Otto I, nominal founder of the Holy Roman Empire, reorganized Northern Italy into a series of fiefs including 'Western Liguria'. Western Liguria was granted to its former overlord Aleramo, a son-in-law of the Italian King Berengar II d'Ivrea. This prestigious scion is the founder and namesake of our dynasty."
 MFA_idea_2: "Crusader Kings"
 MFA_idea_2_desc: "The descendants of Marquess Rainiero became involved in the crusades, most significantly under Bonifacio I in 1204. After crushing the Byzantine Empire, he became King of the newly-created Kingdom of Thessalonica, under the sovereignty of the Latin Emperor of Constantinople. His descendants in turn would hold the royal title until the Kingdom's collapse in 1224."
 MFA_idea_3: "Byzantine Connection"
 MFA_idea_3_desc: "Our forays into crusading were not the only nor the most notable connection we forged with Byzantium. After the fall of the Aleramici dynasty, the Greek Palaiologoi took over the margravial title. We should use these diplomatic ties to our advantage, especially in the event of Byzantium's demise. The rulers of Montferrat could very well be rightful Byzantine Emperors!"
 MFA_idea_4: "Sacro Monte di Crea"
 MFA_idea_4_desc: "Around the fourth century AD Saint Eusebius of Vercelli installed a statue of the Virgin in a remote sanctuary. In 1589 a new, more robust sanctuary was built around the original, complete with frescos and an arboretum called the Parco Naturale del Sacro Monte."
 MFA_idea_5: "Unite the Montferrino Lands"
 MFA_idea_5_desc: "For centuries Montferrat was divided between two power centers, respectively formed around the capital Casale Monferrato and around Canelli. We must consolidate our lands around the pesky city of Asti and forge a direct land connection between the two divided portions of the realm, facilitating movement and defense alike."
 MFA_idea_6: "Anti-Austrian Bulwark"
 MFA_idea_6_desc: "During the Risorgimento, Casale Monferrato was an important defensive emplacement against the hostile Austrian Empire. The Austrians laid siege to the city in 1849 and were driven off by its defenders, and a few years later its defenses were improved even further. We must maintain its fortified status to ensure the French, Spanish, and Germans never occupy our lands."
 MFA_idea_7: "Industrialism"
 MFA_idea_7_desc: "Montferrat must adapt to changing times by becoming an industrial center. The presence of Portland Cement in the hills surrounding Casale Monferrato makes it ideal for the burgeoning cement industry; we must capitalize on this opportunity for national profit."
#Urbino
 URB_ideas: "Urbinate Ideas"
 URB_ideas_start: "Urbinate Traditions"
 URB_ideas_bonus: "Urbinate Ambitions"
 URB_idea_1: "Gateway to the Marches"
 URB_idea_1_desc: "The Eastern region of the Papal States is known as the Marches, due to the presence of the ancient triple march of Ancona, Camerino, and Fermo. In the middle ages it continually fragmented, producing our Urbinate state as the most powerful successor. We hold the keys to transapennine Italy - all who wish to pass must bow to our will."
 URB_idea_2: "Mons Feretrius"
 URB_idea_2_desc: "Mons Feretrius is a strategically important rock formation home to the Forte di San Leo. It was coveted by the Eastern Roman Empire, the Lombard Kingdom of italy, and the German princes, until finally it came under control of the future rulers of Urbino - the eponymous Montefeltro dynasty."
 URB_idea_3: "Condottieri"
 URB_idea_3_desc: "Italy's military legacy is embodied in the condottieri, professional soldiers who worked for the highest bidder and often amassed great wealth and power. Of these already legendary figures, Duke Federico III of Urbino was one of the most vaunted. Federico was a true Renaissance Man, as his military genius came with a remarkable intelligence and tact for leading."
 URB_idea_4: "Palazzo Ducale"
 URB_idea_4_desc: "Building a Ducal Palace for Urbino would signal the prestige and power of the royal family. Prolific architects Luciano Laurana and Donato Bramante have offered to design this glorious living space, where we may fill the 'scriptorium' with Urbino's priceless collection of books and manuscripts."
 URB_idea_5: "Legazione"
 URB_idea_5_desc: "Apostolic Legates were in charge of governing the scattered lands of the Papacy on behalf of the Holy Father. Urbino is important enough to warrant the appointment of a legate, bringing us into more direct communion with the Holy See."
 URB_idea_6: "Count Cagliostro"
 URB_idea_6_desc: "Alessandro di Cagliostro was a self-styled 'magician' and adventurer whose repertoire of scams included alchemy and holistic medicine. Having incurred the wrath of the Papacy and the Inquisition for his actions, he was betrayed to the Pope and imprisoned for being a charlatan - right here in Urbino. It was in the dungeon of San Leo that he ultimately died, and his occult reputation lives with the lands."
 URB_idea_7: "Restore the Duomo"
 URB_idea_7_desc: "Over the centuries the beautiful constructions of the Montefeltro era have become run-down and obsolete. The Duomo, with its three statues of Christian virtue between Saint Augustine and John Chrysostom, should be the first to receive a neoclassical facelift."
