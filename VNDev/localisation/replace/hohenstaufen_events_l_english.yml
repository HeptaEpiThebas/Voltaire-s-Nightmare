 high_kingdom.5: "We Must Bow to the High King"
 high_kingdom.5.t: "We Must Bow to the High King"
 high_kingdom.5.d: "We must respect the rightful sovereignty of the High King of Ireland and bow to him."
 high_kingdom.5.a: "It is our duty."
 high_kingdom.4: "The High Kingdom is Ours"
 high_kingdom.4.t: "The High Kingdom is Ours"
 high_kingdom.4.d: "Our glorious nation has taken the throne of the High Kingdom of Ireland for ourselves!"
 high_kingdom.4.a: "To Glory!"
 high_kingdom.3: "The War is Lost"
 high_kingdom.3.t: "The War is Lost"
 high_kingdom.3.d: "Your nation has failed in its attempt to take the High Kingdom of Ireland."
 high_kingdom.3.a: "I have failed..."
 high_kingdom.2: "Loss of The High Kingdom"
 high_kingdom.2.t: "Loss of The High Kingdom"
 high_kingdom.2.d: "Your people have been humiliated, and you are no longer the high king or Ireland."
 high_kingdom.2.a: "I have failed..."
 high_kingdom.1: "The High Kingdom of Ireland"
 high_kingdom.1.t: "The High Kingdom of Ireland"
 high_kingdom.1.d: "You are the high king of Ireland! Lead the people of Ireland to glory!"
 high_kingdom.1.a: "To Glory!"
 theocracy.1.c: "A Merchant's Child"
 theocracy.1.d: "A Papal Favorite"
 purple_phoenix.1.d: "Though the Empire's prestige is unwavering, succession remains one of its greatest weaknesses. Ambitious nobles and prominent generals have ever been ready to attempt to seize the reins of Imperial power for themselves."
 flavor_gra.1.d: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The last jewel of al-Andalus, a beacon of learning, is now in infidel hands! As the Islamic world reels from this loss, Moorish refugees flock to the Muslim cities and courts of North Africa and the Middle East, bringing with them knowledge, works by exceptional scholars like Abu al-Walid ibn Rushd, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi and Abu Bakr ibn Tufail. Inviting these refugees to $COUNTRY$ might provide an enormous boost to our own efforts in the fields of science and culture."
 tengri_events.51.d: "Fusing our Shamanic traditions with the wide range of Baltic beliefs we have come across have resulted in an ever-growing Pantheon. There is not a malady, disaster, or fate that hasn't got at least one deity to counteract it. This wide acceptance of differing spiritual traditions has led to an increasingly efficient handling of the religious conflicts between the subjects under our control, no matter what they believe."
 cultural_event.5.t: "Jousting Tournament"
 cultural_event.5.d: "We can feel it in the wind. Soon our equestrian elite will be taking to the field, as the chivalrous tradition plays out before the nobility of our nation. The world is changing, but for now: Let the Knights of $COUNTRY$ ride!"
 celestial_empire_events.1.d: "With the fall of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] the last remnants of the Frankish Kingdom have been crushed. The crown's authority and the ancient Salic administration are now clearly seen as defunct concepts and the old Carolingian gentry as a class will have to evolve into something else or perish.\nThough the memory of the Kingdom will live for some time the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] will forever be remembered as the destroyers of the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 celestial_empire_events.3.t: "Gallicization"
 celestial_empire_events.3.d: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have increasingly come to resent the new French customs we have been introducing throughout our realm, from the court to the lowliest feudal lord. Due to this growing distrust of the alien impositions on our old traditions and norms some even openly question our right to rule."
 flavor_lit.EVTNAME1: "Wave of Lutheranism"
 flavor_lit.EVTDESC1: "In Lithuania people were mostly Catholic or Orthodox during the early modern period. However in the last two decades of the 16th century a lot of Lutheran refugees from France, South Germany and Italy arrived. These cultural elite brought fresh ideas to the Duchy of Lithuania, pressed between her Catholic and Orthodox neighbors. The Radziwill family had strong power and had opened the country for influences from abroad. Cities were much more important than in the artistocratic system of Poland, and thus the people of the cities quickly became a cultural and religious melting-pot spreading Lutheranism to the rural lands around them. When whole provinces slowly became Lutheran, the king started to support the Lutheran Faith. First personally and later as a State-religion looking to Prussia and Sweden as ideals. This also meant that Lithuania could take an independent stance between Russia and Poland. However, the many different religions in Lithuania made the government adhere to a very tolerant religious policy at least until the 1640s."
 flavor_lit.EVTNAME2: "Wave of Calvinism"
 flavor_lit.EVTDESC2: "In the 1590s, when the Wave of Lutheranism had started to change the fabric of Lithuanian society, numerous refugees of the Calvinist Faith arrived in a second wave. These were the Dutch, English, French and Spanish fleeing from the narrow-minded Catholic governments of their former countries. The refugees were a mix of farmers and city-dwellers and they influenced the Lithuanians in a similar way as the earlier Lutherans. However, the Lithuanian Magnates in opposition of the king viewed fellow Poland as the perfect societal form. When the king converted to Lutheranism, many of them became Calvinists. Both to underline their difference with the king and because the Calvinist ideals place God before king. The Calvinist faith was also a perfect ideology for them to imprint upon the serfs. They were serfs because God wanted them to be and thus they became more manageable. In the 1630's a growing dissent between the Lutheran state on one hand and the Calvinist and Orthodox magnates on the other could be felt."
 reformed_events.EVTNAME1: "Calvinist Refugees"
 reformed_events.EVTDESC1: "One of our neighbors is ruthlessly oppressing their minority of Calvinist followers. These poor souls wish to escape the persecution and settle in our border province [Root.GetName]. Allowing this would benefit our economy but greatly upset our neighbor..."
 reformed_events.EVTNAME2: "Calvinist Followers Flee"
 reformed_events.EVTDESC2: "Many Calvinist heretics in [Root.GetName] have fled across the border hoping to find a safe haven in [From.GetName]. Allegedly, this was carried out with the tacit sanction of the government of [From.Owner.GetName]."
 reformed_events.EVTDESC3: "Many within the church are of the opinion that we, as a leading Calvinist nation, should send our ministers abroad to ensure that the true reformation continues to spread."
 reformed_events.EVTDESC4: "There are reports of ministers preaching the Calvinist faith have turned up in [Root.GetName]. They appear to come from [From.GetName] in order to encourage the local population to resist and fight back against our attempts to root out this heresy."
 reformed_events.EVTDESC5: "Reformed theologians believe that only those who are predestined to be saved can be saved. But since it is impossible to know who is predestined, a notion has developed that it might be possible to discern that a person is predestined by observing their way of life. As hard work, frugality, social success and wealth are thought to be important consequences of being predestined, it seems to inspire followers of the Reformed faith to strive for reaching them, as well as attracting those who already possess them - like burghers and merchants."
 reformed_events.EVTOPTA5: "Encourage these beliefs"
 reformed_events.EVTDESC6: "Leading theologians are of the opinion that music shouldn't be used in religious sermons. They believe that it distracts people from the matter of importance - worship and seeking knowledge of God - and thus favor the ban of musical instruments in churches."
 reformed_events.EVTDESC7: "[Root.GetName] has seen outbreaks of religious violence as mobs of Calvinist followers vandalize churches and destroy Catholic religious art. The Catholic majority in [Root.GetName] demand that the government immediately take action."
 EVTDESC2011: "As the theologies of Zwingli and his rivals find mainstream acceptance, new reformers have developed on these older ideas. A preacher named Jean Calvin in $CAPITAL$ has put forth a 'Calvinist' school of thought, stressing the complete ruin of humanity's ethical nature. Only with the divine intervention of God can humanity find salvation, turning from rebellion to willing obedience."
 tengri_events.51.d: "Fusing our Shamanic traditions with the wide range of pagan beliefs we have come across has resulted in an ever-growing Pantheon. There is not a malady, disaster or fate that hasn't got at least one deity to counteract it. This wide acceptance of differing spiritual traditions has led to an increasingly efficient handling of the religious conflicts between the subjects under our control, no matter what they believe."
 EVTNAME6163: "Heresy concerns clerics"
 EVTDESC6163: "Our Policy of tolerance to all faiths has led to some of our population deciding to embrace heretical beliefs."
 EVTOPTA6163: "I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
 religious_events.18.c: "We must send word to the Patriarchs."
 religious_events.18.g: "Baptisms for all!"
 religious_events.18.h: "So says scripture."
 religious_events.18.i: "The community will be pleased."
 religious_events.18.j: "New brethren for the flock."
 religious_events.18.k: "Perfection awaits."
 religious_events.18.l: "All are welcome in freedom."
 religious_events.18.m: "In the name of Jan Hus!"
 religious_events.18.n: "Be free in Christ."
 elections.722.d: "The strengthening of the Communia has forced $MONARCH$ to accept the election of a new Podestà. Both the Communia and the Signoria have put forward a new candidate."
 elections.723.d: "The unfortunate passing of $MONARCH$ forces us to hold a premature election. Both the Communia and the Signoria have put forward a new candidate."
 elections.722.a: "A Communia Candidate"
 elections.722.b: "A Signoria Candidate"
 elections.724.t: "Guelph-Ghibelline Allegiance"
 elections.724.d: "The conflicted interests of the Holy Roman Emperors and the Popes has shattered Italian politics into competing factions - the imperial Ghibellines, so named for a certain fortress which was once a local power center, and the religious Guelphs, named for the Welf dynasty. Even long after the Popes and Emperors resolved their differences and open warfare died down throughout the Italian peninsula, the cultural division would remain, forcing ambitious states to side with one set of interests or the other. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must choose which faction to cast [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lot with, and beware the consequences of the inevitably angered opposing faction."
 elections.724.a: "Side with the Guelphs"
 elections.724.b: "Side with the Ghibellines"
 hre_event.4.d: "For years now Imperial Authority over the Kingdom of Italy has been waning. Successive Emperors have failed to impose their will on the Italian states and large areas that are formally part of the Empire have been lost to republics and theocracies who reject the Empire's right to them.\nUnless Italy is firmly brought back into the Empire the states there may slip out of Imperial control forever."
 hre_event.4.a.tt: "Unless the number of Ghibelline rulers is greater than or equal to the number of Guelph rulers from 1490 until 1550 the states there are likely to leave the Empire. Passing Imperial Reforms and improving the Emperor's opinion with states will make them more likely to side with the Ghibellines."
 empire_of_china_in_name.1.t: "King of the Franks in Name"
 empire_of_china_in_name.1.d: "While we have achieved a general recognization as the new Kingdom of the Franks we have yet to earn the respect of the Frankish people. Our great reliance on foreigners in our armies and administration is putting the feudal authority of our dynasty in question.\nUnless we take measures to become a truly Frankish Kingdom we will remain a Kingdom in name only and will appear to have lost our feudal authority."
 empire_of_china_in_name.2.t: "Acceptance of the Franks"
 empire_of_china_in_name.2.d: "Our efforts to integrate the Franks in the state that rules them have born fruit and our claim to feudal authority is no longer in question due to lacking ties to the people themselves. Like many of the foreign conquerors Gaul has seen over the centuries our Kingdom may never come to be seen as truly Frankish in origin but it is truly a Kingdom of the Franks."
 empire_of_china_in_name.2.a: "For the Sons of Ascaric!"
 flavor_fra.EVTDESC9104: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] benefited from the outcome of the hundred year war. The virtual destruction of the feudal nobility enabled [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to unite France more solidly under the royal authority and to promote and ally with the middle class."
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9104: "The Hundred Years War was the last great medieval war. It was a war not just between kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their own personal agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the beginning of the war, there were two nations at the end of it."
 #Institution Events
 institution_events.74.t: "Universities"
 institution_events.74.d: "Several universities claim to be the oldest in Europe, based on various criteria of measurement and semi-apocryphal records of when teaching began in their area. Regardless of who started first, by the middle of the 12th century organized didactic institutions existed across the Western world, from Bologna to Oxford to Paris. In $YEAR$, tutors and learned lecturers in theology, philosophy, classics, science, and other can be heard imparting their knowledge to new generations of young nobles, allowing for a dissemination of academic expertise around the continent. The phenomenon was not limited to Christian powers, as the Islamic world too had a long-established education system where some of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages tabulated their theories, taking influence from Asian and Indian expertise."
 institution_events.74.a: "This changes everything..."
 institution_events.74.a.tt: "Countries that have not yet fully §YEmbraced§! the §Y §! Institution will receive an increasing technology cost penalty of §R1%§! per year up to at most §R50%§!."
 institution_events.740.d: "Several universities claim to be the oldest in Europe, based on various criteria of measurement and semi-apocryphal records of when teaching began in their area.

 institution_events.75.t: "Rise of Guilds"
 institution_events.75.d: "With the rise of academic institutions, it is only natural that institutions of trade should abound as well, letting the bourgeoisie claim their own power alongside the landed gentry. Guilds were associations of merchants and craftsmen, centered around the structure of the City, often with the support of Royal decree. Growing out of post-conquest English law, guilds spread throughought Europe like wildfile in the twelfth and thirteenth century, with an explosion in $YEAR$. The structure of the guild could be replicated on even larger scales, with entire cities banding together into similar leagues of cooperation. The 'Hansa', first mentioned as such in 1267, was a particularly powerful association of traders which controlled Northern European mercantile life for centuries."

 institution_events.76.t: "Chivalry"
 institution_events.76.d: "Chivalric codes of knightly virtue have existed in some form for several centuries, but the 1300s saw them reach their height under such developments as the outbreak of the Hundred Years War. Off the battlefield, knights were encouraged to embody ideals of courtliness, service of the needy, piety, and fairness in competition. These ideals were encoded both in general social mores and in specific works of literature, which spread the romanticized concept of a knight far and wide in $YEAR$."
 institution_events.76.a: "This changes everything..."
 institution_events.76.a.tt: "Countries that have not yet fully §YEmbraced§! the §Y §! Institution will receive an increasing technology cost penalty of §R1%§! per year up to at most §R50%§!."

These ideals were encoded both in general social mores and in specific works of literature, which spread the romanticized concept of a knight far and wide in $YEAR$."
 institution_events.77.t: "Public Health Advances"
 institution_events.77.d: "A crisis has struck Eurasia, the likes of which have never been seen in human history. Priests and heathens, paupers and Emperors alike are mowed down by the thousands due to an invisible threat which looks like it may finally end the era of mankind. However, from the ashes, by the turn of $YEAR$ a newfound attention to public health has emerged. Drawing together the anatomic expertise of Islamic scholarship and Ancient Greek materialists, doctors roam the lands trying to minimize the damage and prevent further outbreaks of disease. Though they know nothing of the vectors which actually translate Bubonic Plague, certain strategies of quarantine and cleanliness have found currency in regions like Milan and saved them from apocalypse. These selfsame methods may pave the way for a better common weal at large in the years to come."

 institution_events.78.t: "Popular Theology"
 institution_events.78.d: "From the turmoil of Mongol invasions, the Hundred Years War, and the Black Death, new methods of approaching religion have emerged. The ball started rolling with figures like John Wycliffe and his Lollard heresy in England, but it wasn't until Jan Hus electrified the European continent that the true weight of populist theological movements was felt. With the contemporary clergy and laity of $YEAR$ both asking pointed questions about ancient traditions, the path lies open for more sophisticated religious hierarchies and secular reasoning. Even the stirrings of some larger reformation can be seen in the cries of street-preachers and God-inspired peasant armies."

 institution_events.79.t: "The Industrial Revolution"
 institution_events.79.d: "Steel, coal, great smokestacks and furnaces towering higher than the mightiest castle of the Middle Ages, or the richest palace of the Early Modern Era... in $YEAR$, building on Enlightenment scientism and continual revolutions in manufacturing technology, the world is embracing Industrialization. Rural populations flock to the cities to find work in new factories, while materiels are pumped out at an astonishing rate to support public and military demand. Not only has the landscape changed, but modes of thinking are shaped by the sudden presence of concrete and iron where pastoral vistas once abounded. Let the poets herald this marriage of mammon and muse!"

#Tributary Events
 tributary_events.1.d: "Our fiefdom relationship with [Root.Overlord.GetName] is certainly very loose but it has still opened up a world of opportunity for gifted officials and entrepreneurs. Many have come to regard [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] as the best career destination, and with every royal tax collection more set out to see the great [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] capital.\nWhile there was some worry that this would be a drain on some of our state's most valued people, it does give us influence in the wider circle of countries around [Root.Overlord.GetName]. The few people that choose to return also have valuable experience that we can put to good use."
 tributary_events.1.b: "It is for the best of the [Root.GetAdjective] subjects."
 tributary_events.2.d: "As a part of the de jure [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] sphere we are increasingly becoming part of the wider [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] cultural world. The [Root.Overlord.Culture.GetName] royal dialect can be heard in the streets and even the high halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], and there is a growing awareness of our fiefdom in the [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName] of [Root.Overlord.GetName]."
 tributary_events.2.a: "A good way to make new foreign friends."
 tributary_events.4.t: "Growing Royal Influence"
 tributary_events.4.d: "While not every state deserves to be part of our fief network it is becoming increasingly clear that our influence is on the rise. Even countries where we have little, if any, direct power feel the need to actively position themselves along the guidelines we set for fiefs in our sphere. In many courts the [Root.Culture.GetName] language is seen now as the language of diplomacy and culture and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] figures as an authority in the minds of men and women far beyond our borders."
 tributary_events.5.t: "The [tributary_advanced_underling.GetAdjective] Tax Collection"
 tributary_events.5.d: "With the recent tax collection from [tributary_advanced_underling.GetName] we have not only received valuable gold, we have also discovered local innovations surpassing our own. It would perhaps be prudent to demand that the [tributary_advanced_underling.GetAdjective] supply us with more of their best and brightest so that we can make their methods ours."
 tributary_events.5.a: "The [Root.GovernmentName] can always use more Administrators."
 tributary_events.5.b: "Let us supply a manor directly in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 tributary_events.5.c: "The [Root.GetAdjective] crown is more than capable of developing things on its own."
 tributary_events.6.t: "[Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Adventurers"
 tributary_events.6.d: "An increased number of tax collections from [Root.Overlord.GetName] has led to the port of [tributary_trader_port.GetCapitalName] becoming the main point of entry for ships from our overlord. The province of [tributary_trader_port.GetName] has also started to attract greater number of [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] traders and adventurers, further allowing the region to prosper.\nSome undoubtedly see it as a good way to avoid the watchful eye of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] royal authorities, however. Encouraging these fortune seekers will likely prolong the economic boom of [tributary_trader_port.GetName] but it might still not be in our best interest."
 tributary_events.7.t: "Abuse of Fief Status"
 tributary_events.7.d: "It has come to our attention that the [tributary_criminal_country.Monarch.GetTitle] of [tributary_criminal_country.GetName] has been harboring a great number of criminals, pirates, and thieves, giving them a safe port against us. This is greatly harming our interests in the realm and has made us lose face to other fiefs as well as to our own court."
 tributary_events.8.t: "Royal Criminals"
 tributary_events.8.d: "[Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] officials are accusing us of harboring economic criminals and sheltering them from the rightful justice of the [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName]. According to the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] we are allowing them to continue their illegal activities inside the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] realm. Our overlord is now moving to crush these operations and have sent an ambassador to us demanding that we pay for it."
 tributary_events.9.t: "Administrating A Fief Network"
 tributary_events.9.d: "We have received complaints from the treasury that the great number of publican ambassadors that reach [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is overwhelming their resources. Receiving the dignitaries in a stately way and even taking care of the gifts they bring is growing to an ever larger and more complicated task, and some fear our diplomatic efforts will suffer for it in the short run."
 tributary_events.9.b: "We must expand the Treasury Department."
 tributary_events.10.d: "A royal mission is more than a journey to pay respect to the [Root.GetTributaryOverlord], it is also an opportunity for negotiation with the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName]. Seeking to capitalize on this it seems competing noble houses in [ningbo_country.GetName] have taken to the habit of sending their own ambassadors to us, claiming to represent the [ningbo_country.Monarch.GetTitle] in order to gain advantages for themselves in the internal politics of [ningbo_country.GetName].\nThis time, however, two such missions arrived at the same time in [ningbo_province.GetName], which made their conflicts from home erupt into bloodshed."
 tributary_events.10.b: "Assign the two factions different Destinations."
 tributary_events.11.d: "We have received word from [Root.Overlord.GetName] that they are imposing restrictions on trade with our fiefdom due to our inability to police local factions from misusing the royal court for their own petty conflicts. Unless we act decisively this is likely to be a problem for years to come."
 tributary_events.13.t: "The Artisanal Goods of [exotic_tributary.GetName]"
 tributary_events.13.d: "Our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] marvels at the great number of artisanal goods brought by the tax collectors from [exotic_tributary.GetName]. Enterprising officials and merchants alike have taken note of how sought after these items are and deals are being formed already. If we don’t act quickly it seems all but certain a smuggling ring will be set up to bring more artisanal goods to the capital."
 tributary_events.14.d: "Ever since we started sending taxes to [Root.Overlord.GetName], the demand for the artisanal goods of our craftsmen have been rather high in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This has lead to the growth of a small trade network, which while not entirely legal, has enriched many [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] officials and entrepreneuring [Root.GetAdjective] merchants.\nHaving discovered the size of the operation the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle] has now imposed much stricter regulations to stop what [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetSheHe] considers to be illegal smuggling. Where there is demand it is hard to stop people from trying to make a profit, however..."
 tributary_events.15.d: "It seems the arrival of our representatives in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] was quite favorably received. The artisanal goods our emissaries brought have lead to an increasing demand for [Root.GetAdjective] products. While the business is not quite legal the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] authorities have turned a blind eye, so far."
 tributary_events.16.d: "Following a lost power struggle a large group of political refugees from the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName] has begun to seek refuge in our fiefdom. The conflict seems insignificant enough that the winning side in [Root.Overlord.GetName] isn't particularly interested in searching for their fleeing compatriots but they may still appreciate if we delivered the refugees to them. On the other hand these are men and women of some ability, who could likely do a lot of good in our country if we allowed them to stay."
 tributary_events.16.b: "Send them back to the royal center."
 tributary_events.18.t: "Fleet Beset By Pirates"
 tributary_events.18.d: "The regular arrival of fleets bringing taxes from abroad to our shores is in some ways a temptation too great to ignore for those that wish to make a quick fortune. A group of pirates have began to target the royal transports and are making a good profit on the many ducats meant for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 tributary_events.19.t: "Rewarding Loyalty"
 tributary_events.19.d: "[tributary_loyal.GetName] is in many ways the ideal model for a fiefdom. Their taxes are regular and their obedience has never once been in question.\nOur fief system provides us with gold and other tokens of respect from those that we grant our protection but apart from promising to defend them we are expected to take care of them even in other ways. Perhaps it is time to show that loyalty will be rewarded?"
 tributary_events.20.d: "While they have promised to help clean up the region it is clear that [From.GetName] has over time grown into a major Pirate Haven. We have always known that they are hardly worthy of our trust but the recent actions of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has actually brought our states closer to each other."

#Reformations
 hohenref_events.1.t: "The Cathar Heresy"
 hohenref_events.1.d: "Heresy is nothing new. In the patristic days of the Catholic church, there were earth-shattering controversies as idiosyncratic theologians formulated and spread controversial ways of exegesis. Since our divorce from the Byzantine rite, however, there has been a newfound attention to perceived abuses within the church. Such sentiments have finally reached a boiling point as a new faction labelling itself 'Cathar' - 'Pure' - has taken hold in our lands. These Cathars are neo-Gnostics and believe that they can achieve 'perfection' by living in ascetic self-denial.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices, though a silver lining to this whole ordeal is a distraction from those same abuses the Cathars rally against."
 hohenref_events.1.b: "Arrest them immediately!"
 hohenref_events.2.t: "The Waldensian Heresy"
 hohenref_events.2.d: "A wealthy merchant named Peter Waldo in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has taken up the Cathar mantle by giving away all his possessions and embracing a life of 'perfection'. The only trouble is, he has organized many other townspeople to join him in a sort of rabble-rousing mission. Chanting their motto 'Lux Lucet In Tenebris', they are spreading the radical and dangerous idea that salvation will come most easily to those who live in Apostolic Poverty. They levy attacks directly against the Church, claiming its richness is an affront to scripture, and prattle on about camels traveling through needle-eyes.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices, though a silver lining to this whole ordeal is a distraction from those same abuses the Waldensians rally against."
 hohenref_events.2.b: "Have this Waldo re-educated."
 hohenref_events.3.t: "The Bosanska Heresy"
 hohenref_events.3.d: "Siezing on rife unrest regarding the religious establishment, a faction within [Root.GetName] has proposed a separation from both the Catholic and Orthodox churches, decrying the very notion of a state-influencing church as contrary to scriptural wisdom. Though critics have charged them as another incarnation of the vile Bogomilist heresy, they deny the accusations flatly, and insist that the truest path for [Root.GetName] is to embrace our own church where no far-away powers can impose their will on us, and practitioners will restrict themselves to private matters of conscience.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices, though a silver lining to this whole ordeal is a distraction from those same abuses the Bosanska rally against."
 hohenref_events.3.b: "Church without power is no church!"
 hohenref_events.4.t: "The Fraticelli Heresy"
 hohenref_events.4.d: "Saint Francis is, of course, an eminently respected Catholic hero. However, discontent within the faith has led a certain monk named Angelo Clareno to promote a new, extremist branch of 'Spiritual Franciscans' who advocate complete poverty and regard the established Church's wealth as damning. They claim any ecclesiastic figure who holds personal wealth forfeits his holy status, and encourage the poor masses into their hermetic lifestyle. Though some have attempted to reach a concordance with the Papacy, Clareno insists on open disobedience. This wouldn't be such a problem, if it wasn't spilling out right into our lands.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices, though a silver lining to this whole ordeal is a distraction from those same abuses the Fraticelli rally against."

 hohenref_events.5.d: "The Cathars, Waldensians, Bosanska, and Fraticelli all have claimed that wealth is scandalous and its influence in the Catholic church is corrupting. We could do well to ignore these claims, but general hostility toward such practices as Indulgences and Simony has resulted in yet another outbreak of anticlerical theology. This time, a professor at [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] University named John Wycliffe asserts Bibles should be translated into the vernacular and the Catholic Church's alleged 'abuses' must be addressed. His Lollards even claim that every man can be his own priest! Regardless, friends in high places have protected them so far, but now they have gotten out of control.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices, though a silver lining to this whole ordeal is a distraction from those same abuses the Lollards rally against."

Feelings of anger at the Catholic establishment have manifested in a [Root.GetAdjective] preacher named Jan Hus, who attacks the Pope himself from his pulpit and spreads controversial ideas on the Eucharist and other church matters. His central thesis is that the universal church is morally bankrupt and must be reformed wholesale, and he has accrued quite a large and violent following. Every action church officials take to restrict his doctrines only causes more unrest.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take further action against their practices, though a silver lining to this whole ordeal is a distraction from those same abuses the Hussites rally against."

Regardless of where it came from, it's here.

Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has isolated [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the governmental palaces to avoid contracting the disease, but it seems to strike everywhere.

One of the most powerful Earls in our lands is Hereweald, son of Godwin - tentatively designating him as our heir would ensure a strong Anglo-Saxon future for the realm, but the Duke of Normandy, whose court protected Eadward for 25 years, also considers himself the heir to England. Of course, appointing Hereweald would also spell the end of the most ancient and noble royal house of Wessex, the Cerdicingas."
 HREMA5: "Make Earl Hereweald heir apparent"
 HREMB5: "The house of Wessex will continue!"
 HREMC5: "Make Duke Guillaume heir apparent"
 HREMT6: "Edward Reassures Us"
 HREMD6: "It is known as truth throughout the land that Edward the Confessor promised his throne to Duke Guillaume. Some foreign foes, however, treacherously claim that this is a lie Guillaume concocted to justify a future invasion. Those doubts have been put to rest now, as Edward specifically and unequivocally reissued this promise to our state."
 HREMA6: "Great news"
 hrema6.tt: "We will peacefully form a Personal Union over them if all goes well."
 HREMT7: "Westminster Abbey"
 HREMD7: "The exact foundation date of the Abbey is disputed, with some claiming it dates back to the seventh century Bishop Mellitus and others pointing to the tenth century Saint Dunstan. Its beautiful carved corbels, arches, and statuettes are now in disrepair, and the monks often can't even spare candles to light up its lofty interior. Edward the Confessor started to fund a renovation project a few years ago in order to have a fitting tomb in which to be buried and to give the abbey the prestige it deserves, but supplies are now running short. The architects request one last lump sum of gold and promise the project will then be completed, adding yet another jewel to the Westminster area."
 HREMA7: "Finish building"
 HREMB7: "Cancel the renovations"
 HREMT8: "Norse Invasion!"
 HREMD8: "It is as we have feared. The death of the good King Eadweard has caused the vile Norwegian barbarian Haraldr 'Hardrada' - Hard Ruler - to invade our lands. Hardrada cites an agreement between the Viking pretender-kings Harthacnut and Magnus which stipulated if one were to die, the other would inherit his lands. Though Magnus himself died before he could launch an invasion of Harthacnut's English fiefs, Hardrada, as his successor, has taken up the job. Worst of all, traitorous Northumbrian lords have supported his endeavor as a way to seek revenge on [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for perceived slights. If we get our hands on these seditious devils, they should be executed on the spot for their treasonous betrayal of the Anglo-Saxon people."
 HREMA8: "Damn them!"
 HREMB8: "Damn them!"
 HREMT9: "Norse Invasion of England"
 HREMD9: "Haraldr Hardrada, King of Norway, has promised us great riches if we assist him in his bid for the English throne. Though his claim seems dubious, we could free ourselves from any nominal English control if we help this suppliant Viking, and perhaps become the next great power within the British Isles."
 HREMA9: "A perfect opportunity"
 HREMB9: "We would never betray England!"
 HREMT10: "Ascension of Ladislaus"
 HREMD10: "Ladislaus von Habsburg earned the monicker 'Posthumous' because he was born after the death of his father. Having inherited the title Archduke of Austria at such a young age, it was only sensible for the more powerful rulers of Styria to take over as nominal regent. Now, however, Ladislaus has come of age, and the Austrian nobles expect us to hand over the reins in full."
 HREMA10: "Extend the regency... permanently!"
 HREMB10: "His time to rule has come"
 HREMT11: "Unification of Switzerland"
 HREMD11: "The strength of the Confederacy throughout the Swiss region has finally led to the creation of a Swiss state. Already the different Cantons are binding together under a new constitution."
 HREMA11: "In Per Tuts!"
 HREMB11: "We are better off alone"
 HREMT12: "A New Canton"
 HREMD12: "A Swiss state has decided to abandon their errant ways and become a Canton! We should welcome them into the Confederacy with open arms."
 HREMA12: "In Per Tuts!"
 HREMT13: "Development of Dutch Identity"
 HREMD13: "With the late emergence of the Netherlands as a unified entity, the old cultural divisions are blurring. Thousands of people are beginning to see themselves not as Saxons or Hollanders but as the Dutch."
 HREMA13: "This can only be good for us"
 HREMT14: "Waldensian Massacre"
 HREMD14: "Europe has been scandalized by the recent massacre of Waldensians by a contingent of French troops. Even those who consider them heretics were shocked by stories of mass-murder and fathers being walked to death with the heads of their sons hung around their necks. A foreign poet has already written a dedicatory poem about the massacre, and much anger is directed at the French state."
 HREMA14: "I should've killed every last one of them!"
 HREMT15: "A Royal Marriage"
 HREMD15: "For many years Ostfriesland has been rocked by dynastic conflicts between the chiefdoms. We now have an opportunity to combine two of the most infamous historical rivals in a time of peace, setting the stage for the creation of a unified East Frisian county."
 HREMA15: "What's in a name?"
 HREMB15: "We should go our own way"
 HREMT16: "Independence of Groningen"
 HREMD16: "The Frisian city of Groningen has been slipping from foreign grasp steadily over the last few centuries. They now wish to formalize the matter and join the other states of West Frisia."
 HREMA16: "Very well"
 HREMB16: "An outrage!"
 HREMT17: "The Ernestine Duchies"
 HREMD17: "The fracturing of a dynasty's lands is sometimes an inevitability. Family members look to our holdings in Thuringia and want some part of it for themselves. Since our monarch has recently passed away, now would be a good time to give them what they want."
 HREMA17: "Make it so"
 HREMB17: "We should keep our lands united"
 ernestinett: "We will cede them the Thuringia Area"
 HREMT18: "Sale of Haigerloch"
 HREMD18: "We have recently heard rumors that the Habsburgs are considering the sale of Haigerloch. It would be a great boon to our fledgling state if we could secure the purchase for ourselves."
 HREMA18: "Pursue the matter."
 HREMB18: "Let it go."
 HREMT19: "Proposal of Land Sale"
 HREMD19: "The rulers of Hohenzollern have heard that we were considering to pawn off Haigerloch and have expressed interest in the deal. The area is insignificant to us, and we could earn a hefty price."
 HREMA19: "Sell it off."
 HREMB19: "It is better with us."
 HREMT20: "Haigerloch Purchase"
 HREMD20: "The Habsburgs have considered our offer and agreed to a deal! The surrounding titles are ours, all that is left is the payment."
 HREMA20: "Gott mit uns!"
 HREMT21: "Purchase Denied"
 HREMD21: "The Habsburgs have heard about our offer but evidently reconsidered their plan to sell. They have decided to keep the land."
 HREMA21: "There's always the hard way..."
 HREMT22: "The Fuggers"
 HREMD22: "The city of Augsburg is home to one of the most illustrious banker families in Europe - the Fuggers. In the late 15th century, they provided loans to the Habsburgs of Tirol and have thus been intertwined with the fate of greater Austria. If we officially invest them with some of our extraneous land, the benefits to administration would be great."
 HREMA22: "The Burgau is theirs."
 HREMB22: "Our land, our hands."
 HREMT23: "The Huguenot Identity"
 HREMD23: "Calvinism has been gaining more and more footholds in France. The local populace does not, however, consider themselves strictly aligned with their Eastern brethren - among various minor differences, they have a particularly fiery passion for Iconoclasm. Naysayers give them the label 'Huguenot' to distinguish them from other branches of Calvinism, and its starting to catch on. This could have important implications for religious relations in France and in Europe as a whole."
 HREMA23: "An interesting development"
 HREMT24: "French Huguenots"
 HREMD24: "With the 'Huguenot' identity established in France, the question of how to proceed comes to the state. Should we promote this identarian separation from other Calvinists?"
 HREMA24: "We shall join the movement"
 HREMB24: "We will remain true to the name of Jean Calvin!"
 HREMT25: "Clash of Kings"
 HREMD25: "We have honored the call of the True Faith by joining this war to decide the fate of Protestantism in the Empire. The battles, however, are the power-play of great Kingdoms and rich nobles with vast estates. On some level, trying to coordinate our own small levies within the larger structure of our sides' armies might be more of a hindrance than a benefit. We can establish peace now and retain the prestige of having honored our duty in the first place."
 HREMA25: "This is a relief."
 HREMB25: "We will fight to the end!"
 HREMT26: "New World Trade"
 HREMD26: "The discovery of the New World in 1492 has spurred colonial ventures from Iberia. Already the colonists have reported strange new crops and animals in this wild land, accompanied by a massive native population. As more colonial cities are established, transatlantic trade must enter Europe through its eastern ports - OUR ports."
 HREMA26: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT27: "Expansion of New World Trade"
 HREMD27: "By now massive swathes of the serene American landscape have been annexed by European powers for their colonial ventures. As naval technology grows ever more advanced, the opportunities for trade profit have increased accordingly."
 HREMA27: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT28: "Expansion of New World Trade"
 HREMD28: "The economic power of these New World possessions has utterly changed the face of Europe. We now have more money than ever before flowing into our ports from across the ocean."
 HREMA28: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT29: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Succession"
 HREMD29: "The passing of our late monarch has raised questions over the rightful heir to the throne. The English claim the closest male relative is actually their own King, but this connection only works by passing through a female intermediary, which our nobility counters is against crown laws. While we have crowned a [Root.GetAdjective] successor, the English could use this as a pretext to invade our nation."
 HREMA29: "Let us hope they don't press the claim..."
 HREMT30: "Claims to [From.GetName]"
 HREMD30: "The passing of the late King of the Franks has raised questions over the rightful heir to the throne. They have crowned a [From.GetAdjective] pretender, but the the closest male relative is actually [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The [From.GetAdjective] nobility has tried to object to our rightful inheritance by claiming the crown cannot pass through a female intermediary, but we can use this as a justification for invasion regardless."
 HREMA30: "We will fight for a century!"
 HREMB30: "There is no sense in pursuing it"
 HREMT31: "Hundred Years' War Victory"
 HREMD31: "The triumph of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] over the pretenders who sought to steal [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rightfully inherited throne has brought a great excitement to the country, as parades march through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] displaying the spoils of our hard-fought war. At last, peasants and nobles alike can put away their arms and the state can be shifted away from a total war ecnonomy to the management of our newly won titles."
 HREMA31: "For [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and Country!"
 HREMT32: "End of the Hundred Years' War"
 HREMD32: "The extinction of the title for which we have so long fought brings with it the extinction of the great war's raison d'être. For now, peasants and nobles alike can put away their arms and the state can be shifted away from a total war ecnonomy to the management of our extant titles."
 HREMA32: "Alas"
 HREMT33: "Holy War"
 HREMD33: "We have completed the Age of Holy Wars objective §Y'Holy War'§! and will now receive extra splendor for the duration of the era."
 HREMA33: "Okay"
 HREMT34: "Tribal Warfare"

 HREMD37: "We have completed the Age of Revolutions objective §Y'Revolutionary'§! and will now receive extra splendor for the duration of the era."
 HREMA37: "Okay"
 HREMT38: "Fake News"
 HREMD38: "Unlicensed printers have been spreading rumors about our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], some of which have seriously undermined the legitimacy of the state. One of our top advisors has warned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] about the issue and formulated a plan to combat these illegitimate sources. He requests the immediate implementation of the new statutes."
 HREMA38: "Don't be rude"
 HREMB38: "Don't be rude!"
 HREMC38: "YOU are fake news!"
 HREMT39: "Rosicrucians"
 HREMD39: "Legend holds that a wise doctor by the name Christian Rosenkreuz discovered certain ancient and esoteric secrets about the earth while studying deep in Islamic territory under the guidance of Sufi mystics.\nAt least, [Root.Monarch.GetName] always thought it was a mere legend... until this strange hooded mendicant showed up in his court demanding an audience. The man explained he was a representative of the secret Rosicrucian fraternal order founded by Rosenkreuz himself, and that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was to be given an opportunity to prove his worth and join as one of the order's eight grandmasters.\nThe mysterious visitor insists the order must be kept a secret or great misfortunes will befall the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and further explains that joining the order demands an oath of bachelordom. The trials of entry may be quite costly, but the rewards - hidden knowledge unthinkable to the general public - will be great."
 HREMA39: "We have no time for such hoaxes"
 HREMB39: "Please, tell me more!"
 HREMT40: "The Test"
 HREMD40: "The hooded mystic has agreed to test [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mettle in the occult arts of alchemy and holistic medicine. Leading the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to a hidden chamber filled with bubbling elixirs and the desiccated corpses of fantastic beasts, he simply points a gnarled finger at the most dangerous looking potions without speaking a word."
 HREMA40: "Let's hope this doesn't explode..."
 HREMB40: "An easy task"
 HREMT41: "Success!"
 HREMD41: "Sweat dripping onto the table, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to stabilize the volatile panacea in the nick of time before disaster. The hooded onlooker smiles a grin of rotted teeth and reveals a red crucifix necklace from some hidden pocket in his robes. He beckons for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to bear the new symbol of his esoteric lineage."
 HREMA41: "For Rosenkreuz!"
 HREMB41: "I feel... younger"
 HREMT42: "Oath Betrayed"
 HREMD42: "By joining the most sacred and secret Rosicrucian order, we took an oath to be a lifelong bachelor. With our late marriage, the oath has been broken, and the Order is ready to excommunicate us for this outrageous transgression against its rules."
 HREMA42: "Beg the Order for forgiveness"
 HREMB42: "Goodbye [Root.Consort.GetName]"
 HREMT43: "Rosicrucian Secrets"
 HREMD43: "With the mystical Sufi knowledge made available to us by the Order, we can reap great rewards for our state. To what end should we put our occult expertise?"
 HREMA43: "Clairvoyance"
 HREMB43: "Draft of silver tongues"
 HREMC43: "Martial manna"
 HREMT44: "Rosicrucian Refugee"
 HREMD44: "A Rosicrucian practitioner has been driven from their homeland by chaotic instability. Knowing our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to be one of the eight followers of Rosenkreuz, they have appealed to our court for protection, offering to share their personal occult secrets and earn their place within the realm."
 HREMA44: "Great"
 HREMB44: "Let them find someone else"
 HREMT45: "A Shared Secret"
 HREMD45: "While our nations act in their own interests in most matters, a great secret held by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the knowledge that our neighboring head of state is also a member of the Rosicrucian order. Though we may meet on the battlefield, there will always be a hidden respect between us."
 HREMA45: "For Rozenkreuz"
 HREMT46: "Order Requests Assistance"
 HREMD46: "Our position as a member of the eight Rosicrucian masters has afforded us many benefits, but it also involves obligations. The order needs our assistance now, but in the interest of secrecy they cannot tell us what exactly they need our help for in the first place."
 HREMA46: "Very well"
 HREMT47: "Foreign Donation"
 HREMD47: "A magnanimous foreign power has sent us a donation of 100 ducats to support our noble fight against the heathens and the impious Christians who wish to subjugate us."
 HREMA47: "Great"
 HREMB47: "Split it with the Livonians"
 HREMT48: "The Sicilian Throne"
 HREMD48: "The late Friedrich II von Hohenstaufen, great Emperor that he was, left his legitimate children in control of the family's titles in Swabia and Tuscany, while the bastard Manfred received a mere administrative role in Sicily and the right of regency if an underaged ruler were to succeed. With Friedrich dead, the time has come to turn over the realm to its rightful heirs. Of course, with their powerbase being so far away from the verdant beaches of Southern Italy, it would be more than a small challenge for them to enforce their demands in the face of resistance..."
 HREMA48: "Turn over the title"
 HREMB48: "'Molon Labe', as the Greeks say"
 HREMT49: "The Sicilian Throne"
 HREMD49: "Our kinsman [From.Monarch.GetTitle] Friedrich of Sicily has regretfully died, leaving the throne vacant. His illegitimate son Manfred, previously acting as a local governor and royal administrator, has ignored our rightful agnatic claim to the throne and refused to turn over control of the realm. We must send an army down at once to claim what is ours by succession!"
 HREMA49: "War is the continuation of politics by other means..."
 HREMT50: "Sicilian Pretender!"
 HREMD50: "Friedrich II's illegitimate son Manfred has so far been a talented administrator to our Kingdom, having handed it over as promised upon the death of the good Emperor. We have just learned, however, that a false report of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s death has spurred Manfred to crown himself King of Sicily in our stead! We must divert troops immediately to reclaim the title."
 HREMA50: "He will pay for his treachery"
 HREMT51: "Turks Raid Province!"
 HREMD51: "A small Turkish army has broken through the Byzantine Limes and wreaked havoc on the countryside. The local governor begs for the protection of the Imperial Army, and fears that the region may be lost entirely to the Turks without immediate attention."
 HREMA51: "Send resources"
 HREMB51: "Ignore it"
 HREMT52: "Turks Raid Province!"
 HREMD52: "The Turks have staged an incursion deep into our territories, slaughtering villages and carrying away great piles of loot. This theft of Imperial property is unconscionable, and our Stretegos recommends we divert a contingent of troops to guard the affected region."
 HREMA52: "Send resources"
 HREMB52: "Ignore it"
 HREMT53: "Turks Raid Coast!"
 HREMD53: "Turkish attacks on coastal lands in Anatolia have gotten out of control, with certain coastal forts being siezed for weeks before local forces could drive out the heathen invaders. The local governor begs us to provide naval support, warning that entire coastal provinces could be lost to Turkish hands."
 HREMA53: "Send resources"
 HREMB53: "Ignore it"
 HREMT54: "Turks Raid Coast!"
 HREMD54: "A Turkish fleet has sallied out from the Levant to pester Byzantine shipping and coastal cities. Many citizens have even been stolen away as slaves. The local Strategos insists that the Imperial navy needs to turn their attention to the area and provide extra sailors."
 HREMA54: "Send resources"
 HREMB54: "Ignore it"
 HREMT55: "Turks Raid Supply Lines!"
 HREMD55: "The Turks have made a precision strike on our supply lines and roads, throwing the flow of administrative logistics into chaos. Local cities have personally requested the help of the Imperial court, claiming that with proper funding they will be better able to withstand the constant Turkish incursions."
 HREMA55: "Send resources"
 HREMB55: "Ignore it"
 HREMT56: "Turks Raid Supply Lines!"
 HREMD56: "The Turks have staged another incursion into our territories, this time harassing the administrative center of one of our Anatolian Themes. The local governor is begging us for help and warns that the entire Theme could fall into heathen hands without Imperial funds."
 HREMA56: "Send resources"
 HREMB56: "Ignore it"
 HREMT57: "The Battle of Manzikert"
 HREMD57: "Continued cat-and-mouse raids along the Byzantine-Seljuk border have invoked the ire of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], who has finally amassed a large army of Imperial troops, Varangians, and foreign mercenaries, even including a group of Turks. The great Seljuk Sultan, Alp Arslan, is rumored to likewise be the personal leader of the latest marauding Turkish army. In the narrow passage at Manzikert, the two great armies have finally met in an unavoidable engagement.\nThe frantic dance of horses and infantrymen has kicked a storm of dust into the air, and even the peripheral scouts are having trouble seeing how the battle proceeds..."
 HREMA57: "It seems one side is routing..."
 HREMT58: "Manzikert Lost!"
 HREMD58: "As the dust cleared, the full extent of the catastrophe became apparent. The cowardly 'mercenary' Franks had abandoned the battlefield, and the ancient Varangian Guard was wiped out entirely. The greatest nobles of the Byzantine Empire were either killed or captured, with the Turks demanding a ransom that would shake the Imperial coffers to the core. Though this defeat doesn't spell the wholesale collapse of our Empire, the way for further Turkish expansion into Anatolia now lies wide open."
 HREMA58: "Disastrous news"
 HREMT59: "Manzikert Won!"
 HREMD59: "As the dust cleared, the full extent of the victory became apparent. With the combined might of the various troop detachments, the much smaller Turkish force broke rank and fell into disorder. Alp Arslan was last seen riding headlong into a company of Varangians and is presumed dead. With a sizeable force wiped out and their leader killed in action, the Seljuk Empire has plunged almost immediately into civil war as various warlords vie for the now vacant throne. Though their borders are still secure, it seems the Turks will no longer be a bother to the true holy and Roman empire."
 HREMA59: "In Hoc Signo Vinces!"
 HREMT60: "The Turks Arrive"
 HREMD60: "Following the string of Byzantine defeats after Manzikert, the Seljuk Turks were content to annex the lands of the Armenians and made little attempt to break through the reinforced new Byzantine borders in central Anatolia. Now, however, internal politics have led the supreme Seljuk Shah to recognize a new state centered on Iconium for one of his relatives... the pretender has the gall to call it 'The Sultanate of Rum', stealing the rightful title of the Rhomaioi. The new Sultan has now directed his full attention at the complete conquest of Anatolia and the export of Islam to the Christian East."
 HREMA60: "God help us"
 HREMT61: "Province Falls!"
 HREMD61: "The occupation of $PROVINCENAME$ by the hostile invaders $CONTROLLERNAME$ has taken quite a toll on the local population. All resistance has collapsed, and the province is effectively lost to their power."
 HREMA61: "We will reconquer it later"
 HREMB61: "Tell them to hold out"
 HREMT62: "Komnenian Restoration"
 HREMD62: "With most of Anatolia lost, the Byzantine [Root.GovernmentName] is in a state of chaos, now dealing with attempted conquests by the Seljuks and ambitious Italian powers. The current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s weakness has caused unrest throughout the heartlands, and a skilled general named Alexios Komnenos has proved his worth by putting down many rebellions and defending against hostile powers.\nThis Alexios seems to have near universal support, and abdicating in favor of him might be the only way to save Byzantium from further calamities. However, doing so might also open the [Root.GovernmentName] up to even more invasions under the pretext of monarchical illegitimacy."
 HREMA62: "God is with Alexios!"
 HREMB62: "God is with me!"
 HREMT63: "Rome Needs an Heir"
 HREMD63: "The age of the current Byzantine [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the lack of a legitimate heir has caused concern across the [Root.GovernmentName]. Many expect [Root.Monarch.GetName] to nominate a promising young noble to be their successor, establishing the wellsprings of a new powerful dynasty to lead the state to further glory."
 HREMA63: "A Doukid noble"
 HREMB63: "A Komnenid noble"
 HREMC63: "A court favorite"
 HREMDD63: "No it doesn't"
 HREMT64: "Switzerland"
 HREMD64: "Our supreme position within the Confederacy, and the general strength of our alliance throughout the Swiss region, has allowed us to end the era of Cantons and bring on the era of a semi-unified Swiss state. No more shall foreign powers subjugate us!"
